## 7.9 Licenses, Franchises, and Customer Lists

In the realm of accounting, intangible assets such as licenses, franchises, and customer lists hold significant value for businesses. These assets, derived from contractual or legal rights, are crucial for generating revenue and maintaining competitive advantages. Understanding how to account for these intangibles is essential for accurate financial reporting and compliance with Canadian accounting standards. This section delves into the recognition, measurement, and disclosure of licenses, franchises, and customer lists, providing practical insights and examples relevant to Canadian accounting professionals.

### Understanding Intangible Assets

Intangible assets are non-physical assets that provide economic benefits to a business. Unlike tangible assets, such as machinery or buildings, intangible assets do not have a physical presence. However, they can be just as valuable, if not more so, due to their potential to generate future economic benefits. Common examples include patents, trademarks, copyrights, goodwill, and the focus of this section: licenses, franchises, and customer lists.

#### Key Characteristics of Intangible Assets

1. **Identifiability**: Intangible assets must be identifiable, meaning they can be separated from the entity and sold, transferred, licensed, or rented. Alternatively, they may arise from contractual or other legal rights.

2. **Control**: The entity must have control over the asset, meaning it can benefit from the asset and restrict others from accessing those benefits.

3. **Future Economic Benefits**: The asset must be expected to generate future economic benefits, such as revenue streams, cost savings, or other advantages.

### Licenses

Licenses grant the holder the right to use a particular asset or conduct a specific activity, often in exchange for a fee. They are prevalent in various industries, including technology, pharmaceuticals, and media.

#### Accounting for Licenses

**Recognition**: Licenses are recognized as intangible assets when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity and the cost of the asset can be reliably measured.

**Measurement**: Initially, licenses are measured at cost, which includes the purchase price and any directly attributable costs necessary to prepare the asset for its intended use.

**Amortization**: Licenses with finite useful lives are amortized over their useful life. The amortization method should reflect the pattern in which the asset's economic benefits are consumed. For licenses with indefinite useful lives, amortization is not required, but they must be tested for impairment annually.

**Example**: A software company acquires a license to use a proprietary technology for five years at a cost of $500,000. The company recognizes the license as an intangible asset and amortizes it over the five-year period.

#### Regulatory Considerations

Under IFRS, licenses are accounted for under IAS 38 - Intangible Assets. In Canada, the Accounting Standards for Private Enterprises (ASPE) Section 3064 provides guidance on intangible assets, including licenses.

### Franchises

Franchises are agreements that allow one party (the franchisee) to operate a business using the branding, products, and operational methods of another party (the franchisor). Franchises are common in industries such as fast food, retail, and hospitality.

#### Accounting for Franchises

**Recognition**: Franchise rights are recognized as intangible assets when the franchisee has the right to use the franchisor's brand and business model in exchange for a fee.

**Measurement**: The initial measurement of franchise rights includes the franchise fee and any other costs directly attributable to securing the franchise agreement.

**Amortization**: Franchise rights with finite useful lives are amortized over their useful life. The amortization method should reflect the pattern of economic benefits. Franchise rights with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment testing.

**Example**: A restaurant chain pays $100,000 for the rights to open a franchise location. The franchise agreement lasts for 10 years. The restaurant recognizes the franchise rights as an intangible asset and amortizes them over the 10-year period.

#### Regulatory Considerations

Franchise agreements are accounted for under IFRS and ASPE, with specific guidance provided in IAS 38 and ASPE Section 3064.

### Customer Lists

Customer lists are compilations of customer information that can be used for marketing and sales purposes. They are valuable assets for businesses seeking to expand their customer base and increase sales.

#### Accounting for Customer Lists

**Recognition**: Customer lists are recognized as intangible assets when they are acquired separately or as part of a business combination, and it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity.

**Measurement**: Initially, customer lists are measured at cost, which may include the purchase price and any directly attributable costs necessary to make the list ready for use.

**Amortization**: Customer lists with finite useful lives are amortized over their useful life. The amortization method should reflect the pattern of economic benefits. Customer lists with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment testing.

**Example**: A marketing firm acquires a customer list for $50,000. The list is expected to generate revenue for five years. The firm recognizes the customer list as an intangible asset and amortizes it over the five-year period.

#### Regulatory Considerations

Customer lists are accounted for under IFRS and ASPE, with guidance provided in IAS 38 and ASPE Section 3064.

### Impairment Testing

Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, such as certain licenses, franchises, and customer lists, must be tested for impairment annually. Impairment occurs when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.

#### Impairment Testing Process

1. **Identify the Cash-Generating Unit (CGU)**: Determine the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows independently.

2. **Calculate the Recoverable Amount**: Estimate the asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.

3. **Compare the Carrying Amount to the Recoverable Amount**: If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, recognize an impairment loss.

4. **Recognize the Impairment Loss**: Reduce the carrying amount of the asset to its recoverable amount and recognize the loss in the income statement.

**Example**: A company holds a license with an indefinite useful life. During the annual impairment test, the company determines that the license's recoverable amount is $200,000, while its carrying amount is $250,000. The company recognizes an impairment loss of $50,000.

### Disclosure Requirements

Entities must provide comprehensive disclosures about their intangible assets, including licenses, franchises, and customer lists. These disclosures help users of financial statements understand the nature, carrying amount, and amortization of intangible assets.

#### Key Disclosure Requirements

1. **Description of Intangible Assets**: Provide a description of the intangible assets, including their nature and useful lives.

2. **Carrying Amount**: Disclose the carrying amount of each class of intangible assets.

3. **Amortization and Impairment**: Disclose the amortization methods used, the amortization period, and any impairment losses recognized.

4. **Reconciliation of Carrying Amounts**: Provide a reconciliation of the carrying amount at the beginning and end of the period, showing additions, disposals, amortization, and impairment.

5. **Significant Estimates and Judgments**: Disclose any significant estimates and judgments made in determining the useful lives and impairment of intangible assets.

### Practical Examples and Case Studies

**Case Study 1: Franchise Accounting in the Fast Food Industry**

A fast-food chain enters into a franchise agreement with a new franchisee. The franchisee pays an initial fee of $150,000 and agrees to pay ongoing royalties based on sales. The franchise agreement lasts for 15 years.

- **Recognition**: The franchisee recognizes the initial fee as an intangible asset.
- **Measurement**: The franchisee measures the asset at the cost of $150,000.
- **Amortization**: The franchisee amortizes the asset over the 15-year period, reflecting the pattern of economic benefits.

**Case Study 2: Impairment Testing of a Customer List**

A telecommunications company acquires a customer list for $200,000. The list is expected to generate revenue for 10 years. After three years, the company experiences a decline in customer retention rates.

- **Impairment Testing**: The company conducts an impairment test and determines that the recoverable amount of the customer list is $120,000, while its carrying amount is $140,000.
- **Impairment Loss**: The company recognizes an impairment loss of $20,000.

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

**Best Practices**

1. **Regularly Review Useful Lives**: Periodically review the useful lives of intangible assets to ensure they reflect the expected pattern of economic benefits.

2. **Conduct Impairment Tests Annually**: For intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, conduct impairment tests annually and whenever there is an indication of impairment.

3. **Provide Comprehensive Disclosures**: Ensure that disclosures about intangible assets are comprehensive and transparent, providing users with a clear understanding of the assets' nature and financial impact.

**Common Pitfalls**

1. **Overlooking Impairment Indicators**: Failing to recognize indicators of impairment can lead to overstated asset values and financial statements.

2. **Inadequate Amortization Methods**: Using inappropriate amortization methods can result in inaccurate expense recognition and financial reporting.

3. **Insufficient Disclosures**: Incomplete or unclear disclosures can hinder users' ability to understand the financial statements and assess the entity's performance.

### Exam Focus and Preparation Tips

1. **Understand Key Concepts**: Familiarize yourself with the recognition, measurement, and disclosure requirements for licenses, franchises, and customer lists.

2. **Practice Impairment Calculations**: Practice calculating impairment losses and conducting impairment tests for intangible assets.

3. **Review Regulatory Standards**: Review the relevant sections of IFRS and ASPE that pertain to intangible assets, focusing on IAS 38 and ASPE Section 3064.

4. **Work Through Practice Problems**: Solve practice problems and case studies to reinforce your understanding of intangible asset accounting.

5. **Stay Updated on Standards**: Keep abreast of any changes or updates to accounting standards related to intangible assets.
