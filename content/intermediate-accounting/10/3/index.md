## 10.3 Treasury Stock Transactions

Treasury stock transactions involve the reacquisition and reissuance of a company's own shares. Understanding these transactions is crucial for accounting professionals as they impact a company's financial statements and shareholders' equity. In this section, we will delve into the accounting treatment of treasury stock under Canadian accounting standards, explore practical examples, and discuss the implications of these transactions on financial reporting.

### **Understanding Treasury Stock**

**Definition and Purpose**

Treasury stock refers to shares that were once part of the outstanding shares of a company but were later reacquired by the company itself. These shares are not considered when calculating dividends or earnings per share (EPS) and do not have voting rights. Companies may choose to reacquire shares for various reasons, including:

- **To increase earnings per share** by reducing the number of shares outstanding.
- **To provide shares for employee compensation plans**.
- **To prevent hostile takeovers** by reducing the number of shares available in the market.
- **To return surplus cash to shareholders**.

**Accounting for Treasury Stock**

In Canada, the accounting for treasury stock is governed by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted in Canada and the Accounting Standards for Private Enterprises (ASPE). The treatment of treasury stock can vary based on the accounting framework used.

### **Methods of Accounting for Treasury Stock**

There are two primary methods for accounting for treasury stock: the cost method and the par value method. The choice of method can affect the presentation of financial statements.

#### **1. Cost Method**

Under the cost method, treasury stock is recorded at the cost of reacquisition. This method is commonly used and is straightforward in terms of accounting entries.

**Journal Entries for Reacquisition:**

When a company reacquires its shares, the following journal entry is made:

```
Debit: Treasury Stock (at cost)
Credit: Cash
```

**Example:**

Suppose Company XYZ reacquires 1,000 shares at $10 per share. The journal entry would be:

```
Debit: Treasury Stock $10,000
Credit: Cash $10,000
```

**Reissuance of Treasury Stock:**

When treasury stock is reissued, the accounting treatment depends on whether the shares are reissued at a price above or below the cost.

- **Reissuance Above Cost:**

  If the shares are reissued at a price higher than the cost, the excess is credited to Additional Paid-In Capital (APIC).

  **Example:**

  If Company XYZ reissues the 1,000 shares at $12 per share, the journal entry would be:

  ```
  Debit: Cash $12,000
  Credit: Treasury Stock $10,000
  Credit: Additional Paid-In Capital $2,000
  ```

- **Reissuance Below Cost:**

  If the shares are reissued at a price lower than the cost, the difference is first debited to APIC, and if APIC is insufficient, the remainder is debited to Retained Earnings.

  **Example:**

  If Company XYZ reissues the 1,000 shares at $8 per share, the journal entry would be:

  ```
  Debit: Cash $8,000
  Debit: Additional Paid-In Capital $2,000 (if available)
  Debit: Retained Earnings (if APIC is insufficient)
  Credit: Treasury Stock $10,000
  ```

#### **2. Par Value Method**

Under the par value method, treasury stock is recorded at its par value, and any difference between the par value and the reacquisition cost is adjusted against APIC or Retained Earnings.

**Journal Entries for Reacquisition:**

When a company reacquires its shares, the following journal entry is made:

```
Debit: Treasury Stock (at par value)
Debit: Additional Paid-In Capital (or Retained Earnings)
Credit: Cash
```

**Example:**

Suppose Company XYZ reacquires 1,000 shares with a par value of $5 at $10 per share. The journal entry would be:

```
Debit: Treasury Stock $5,000
Debit: Additional Paid-In Capital $5,000
Credit: Cash $10,000
```

**Reissuance of Treasury Stock:**

The reissuance under the par value method follows similar principles to the cost method, with adjustments made to APIC or Retained Earnings based on the reissuance price relative to par value.

### **Regulatory Considerations and Compliance**

**Canadian Accounting Standards**

In Canada, companies must adhere to IFRS or ASPE when accounting for treasury stock transactions. These standards ensure consistency and transparency in financial reporting.

- **IFRS:** Under IFRS, treasury shares are recognized as a deduction from equity. The cost method is typically used, and any gains or losses on reissuance are recognized in equity, not in the income statement.

- **ASPE:** Similar to IFRS, ASPE requires treasury shares to be deducted from equity. The accounting treatment under ASPE aligns closely with the cost method.

**Disclosure Requirements**

Companies must disclose treasury stock transactions in their financial statements, including:

- The number of shares reacquired and reissued.
- The cost of reacquisition and the proceeds from reissuance.
- The impact on shareholders' equity.

### **Practical Examples and Case Studies**

**Case Study: Company ABC**

Company ABC, a Canadian public company, decides to buy back 5,000 shares at $15 per share to support its employee stock option plan. The shares have a par value of $1.

**Reacquisition Entry:**

```
Debit: Treasury Stock $75,000
Credit: Cash $75,000
```

Later, Company ABC reissues 3,000 of these shares at $18 per share.

**Reissuance Entry:**

```
Debit: Cash $54,000
Credit: Treasury Stock $45,000
Credit: Additional Paid-In Capital $9,000
```

**Impact on Financial Statements**

The treasury stock transactions affect the equity section of the balance sheet. The reacquisition reduces total equity, while the reissuance increases cash and APIC, partially offsetting the reduction in equity.

### **Common Pitfalls and Challenges**

**1. Misclassification of Treasury Stock**

A common mistake is misclassifying treasury stock as an asset. Treasury stock should be reported as a contra-equity account, reducing total shareholders' equity.

**2. Incorrect Calculation of Gains or Losses**

Gains or losses on the reissuance of treasury stock should not be recognized in the income statement. Instead, they should be adjusted within equity accounts.

**3. Inadequate Disclosure**

Failure to provide adequate disclosure of treasury stock transactions can lead to compliance issues and misinterpretation of financial statements by users.

### **Best Practices and Strategies**

- **Ensure Accurate Record-Keeping:** Maintain detailed records of all treasury stock transactions, including dates, quantities, and prices.
- **Regularly Review Accounting Policies:** Ensure that the chosen accounting method aligns with regulatory requirements and company policies.
- **Provide Comprehensive Disclosures:** Clearly disclose the nature and impact of treasury stock transactions in financial statements.

### **Exam Preparation Tips**

- **Understand Key Concepts:** Focus on the differences between the cost and par value methods, and the impact of treasury stock transactions on financial statements.
- **Practice Journal Entries:** Work through examples of reacquisition and reissuance to reinforce understanding.
- **Review Regulatory Standards:** Familiarize yourself with IFRS and ASPE requirements related to treasury stock.

### **Conclusion**

Treasury stock transactions are a critical aspect of shareholders' equity management. By understanding the accounting treatment, regulatory requirements, and practical implications, you can effectively navigate these transactions in both exam scenarios and professional practice.
