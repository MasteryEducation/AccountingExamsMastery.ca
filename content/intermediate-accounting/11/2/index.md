## 11.2 Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities

In the realm of accounting, understanding deferred tax assets and liabilities is crucial for accurate financial reporting and compliance with Canadian accounting standards. This section delves into the recognition and measurement of these tax elements, focusing on the future tax consequences of temporary differences. By the end of this section, you will have a comprehensive understanding of how deferred tax assets and liabilities impact financial statements and how to apply these concepts in practice.

### Understanding Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities

Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences between the accounting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. These differences lead to variations in taxable income and accounting income, which are recognized in financial statements.

#### Temporary Differences

**Temporary differences** are differences between the tax base of an asset or liability and its carrying amount in the financial statements. These differences will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future periods when the carrying amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled. Temporary differences can be classified into two categories:

1. **Taxable Temporary Differences:** These differences result in taxable amounts in future periods, leading to deferred tax liabilities. For example, accelerated depreciation for tax purposes compared to accounting purposes creates a taxable temporary difference.

2. **Deductible Temporary Differences:** These differences result in deductible amounts in future periods, leading to deferred tax assets. An example is a warranty expense recognized for accounting purposes before it is deductible for tax purposes.

#### Deferred Tax Assets

A **deferred tax asset** is recognized for deductible temporary differences, carryforward of unused tax losses, and carryforward of unused tax credits. These assets represent the amount of income taxes recoverable in future periods due to these differences.

##### Recognition Criteria

According to IFRS and ASPE, deferred tax assets are recognized when it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilized. This involves assessing the likelihood of future profitability and the availability of taxable income.

##### Measurement

Deferred tax assets are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realized, based on tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.

#### Deferred Tax Liabilities

A **deferred tax liability** is recognized for all taxable temporary differences, except to the extent that the deferred tax liability arises from:

- The initial recognition of goodwill.
- The initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit (tax loss).

##### Measurement

Deferred tax liabilities are measured using the tax rates expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled, based on tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.

### Practical Examples and Scenarios

To illustrate the concepts of deferred tax assets and liabilities, consider the following examples:

#### Example 1: Accelerated Depreciation

A company purchases machinery for $100,000. For accounting purposes, the machinery is depreciated over 10 years using the straight-line method. For tax purposes, the machinery is depreciated over 5 years using an accelerated method. This creates a taxable temporary difference, resulting in a deferred tax liability.

- **Accounting Depreciation:** $10,000 per year
- **Tax Depreciation:** $20,000 per year

In the first year, the taxable temporary difference is $10,000 ($20,000 tax depreciation - $10,000 accounting depreciation), leading to a deferred tax liability.

#### Example 2: Warranty Expense

A company recognizes a warranty expense of $5,000 for accounting purposes, which is not deductible for tax purposes until the warranty claims are paid. This creates a deductible temporary difference, resulting in a deferred tax asset.

- **Accounting Expense:** $5,000
- **Tax Deduction:** $0 (until claims are paid)

The $5,000 deductible temporary difference results in a deferred tax asset.

### Recognition and Measurement Principles

The recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities are governed by several principles under IFRS and ASPE:

#### Recognition

- **Deferred Tax Assets:** Recognized when it is probable that future taxable profits will be available to utilize the deductible temporary differences.
- **Deferred Tax Liabilities:** Recognized for all taxable temporary differences, except in specific circumstances as noted earlier.

#### Measurement

- **Tax Rates:** Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates expected to apply when the asset is realized or the liability is settled.
- **Tax Laws:** Measurement is based on tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.

### Impact on Financial Statements

Deferred tax assets and liabilities impact the financial statements by affecting the income tax expense and the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities. The recognition of these tax elements can lead to significant variations in reported net income and equity.

#### Income Statement Impact

The income tax expense reported in the income statement includes both current tax and deferred tax. Deferred tax expense or benefit arises from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities during the reporting period.

#### Balance Sheet Impact

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented in the balance sheet as non-current items. They are offset if the entity has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority.

### Real-World Applications and Regulatory Scenarios

In practice, accountants must navigate various complexities when dealing with deferred tax assets and liabilities. This includes understanding the tax implications of business transactions, changes in tax laws, and the impact of international operations.

#### Canadian Accounting Standards

In Canada, the recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities are guided by IFRS for publicly accountable enterprises and ASPE for private enterprises. CPA Canada provides additional resources and guidance for accountants to ensure compliance with these standards.

#### International Considerations

While the focus is on Canadian standards, it is essential to understand how deferred tax accounting aligns with international practices. The IFRS framework is widely adopted globally, and understanding these standards can enhance your ability to work in international contexts.

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

When dealing with deferred tax assets and liabilities, consider the following best practices and common pitfalls:

#### Best Practices

- **Regular Review:** Continuously review deferred tax balances to ensure they reflect current tax laws and business circumstances.
- **Documentation:** Maintain thorough documentation of the assumptions and judgments used in recognizing and measuring deferred tax assets and liabilities.
- **Collaboration:** Work closely with tax professionals to understand the implications of tax laws and regulations on deferred tax accounting.

#### Common Pitfalls

- **Over-optimism:** Avoid overly optimistic assumptions about future profitability when recognizing deferred tax assets.
- **Neglecting Changes:** Stay informed about changes in tax laws that may impact deferred tax balances.
- **Inadequate Disclosure:** Ensure comprehensive disclosure of deferred tax assets and liabilities in financial statements.

### Exam Strategies and Practical Tips

- **Understand the Concepts:** Ensure a solid understanding of the underlying principles of deferred tax accounting, including temporary differences and tax rates.
- **Practice Calculations:** Work through practice problems to become proficient in calculating deferred tax assets and liabilities.
