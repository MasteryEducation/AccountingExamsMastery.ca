## 6.6 Revaluation Model under IFRS

The Revaluation Model under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) offers an alternative to the cost model for measuring property, plant, and equipment (PP&E). This model allows entities to revalue their assets to fair value, providing a more current reflection of an asset's worth on the balance sheet. Understanding this model is crucial for Canadian accounting exams, as it involves intricate accounting principles and requires careful consideration of various factors.

### **Understanding the Revaluation Model**

The Revaluation Model, as outlined in IAS 16 - Property, Plant and Equipment, permits entities to carry an asset at its revalued amount, which is its fair value at the date of revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. This approach contrasts with the cost model, where assets are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

#### **Key Principles of the Revaluation Model**

1. **Fair Value Measurement**: The revaluation model requires assets to be measured at fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

2. **Regular Revaluations**: To ensure that the carrying amount does not differ materially from fair value, revaluations should be made with sufficient regularity. The frequency of revaluations depends on the volatility of the fair values of the assets.

3. **Entire Class of Assets**: When an asset is revalued, the entire class of assets to which it belongs must be revalued. This ensures consistency and comparability across similar assets.

4. **Revaluation Surplus**: Any increase in the asset's carrying amount as a result of revaluation is credited to other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity under the heading of revaluation surplus.

5. **Revaluation Decrease**: A decrease in the asset's carrying amount as a result of revaluation is recognized in profit or loss. However, if there is a credit balance in the revaluation surplus for that asset, the decrease is recognized in other comprehensive income to the extent of any credit balance existing in the revaluation surplus.

6. **Subsequent Depreciation**: After revaluation, depreciation is based on the revalued amount of the asset and its remaining useful life.

### **Practical Examples and Case Studies**

#### **Example 1: Revaluation of a Building**

Consider a company that owns a building initially recorded at a cost of $500,000. The building is depreciated over 25 years using the straight-line method. After 10 years, the company decides to revalue the building. The fair value of the building is determined to be $600,000 at the revaluation date.

**Steps in Revaluation:**

1. **Determine the Carrying Amount**: 
   - Original cost: $500,000
   - Accumulated depreciation after 10 years: $200,000 ($500,000/25 years * 10 years)
   - Carrying amount before revaluation: $300,000

2. **Calculate the Revaluation Surplus**:
   - Fair value: $600,000
   - Carrying amount before revaluation: $300,000
   - Revaluation surplus: $300,000

3. **Journal Entries**:
   - Dr. Accumulated Depreciation $200,000
   - Dr. Building $100,000
   - Cr. Revaluation Surplus (Equity) $300,000

4. **Subsequent Depreciation**:
   - New carrying amount: $600,000
   - Remaining useful life: 15 years
   - New annual depreciation: $40,000 ($600,000/15 years)

#### **Example 2: Revaluation Decrease**

Suppose the same building's fair value decreases to $250,000 in the subsequent revaluation.

**Steps in Revaluation:**

1. **Determine the Carrying Amount**:
   - Carrying amount after previous revaluation: $600,000
   - Accumulated depreciation for one year: $40,000
   - Carrying amount before revaluation: $560,000

2. **Calculate the Revaluation Decrease**:
   - Fair value: $250,000
   - Carrying amount before revaluation: $560,000
   - Revaluation decrease: $310,000

3. **Journal Entries**:
   - Dr. Revaluation Surplus (Equity) $300,000
   - Dr. Loss on Revaluation (Profit or Loss) $10,000
   - Cr. Building $310,000

### **Regulatory Scenarios and Compliance Considerations**

#### **Canadian Context**

In Canada, the adoption of IFRS is mandatory for publicly accountable enterprises, including listed companies. The revaluation model is an option under IFRS but is not commonly used in Canada due to the complexity and cost of regular revaluations. However, understanding this model is essential for Canadian accounting exams, as it may appear in both theoretical and practical questions.

#### **Compliance with IFRS**

Entities opting for the revaluation model must comply with the disclosure requirements under IAS 16. This includes:

- The effective date of the revaluation.
- Whether an independent valuer was involved.
- The methods and significant assumptions applied in estimating the fair values.
- The extent to which fair values were determined directly by reference to observable prices in an active market or recent market transactions on an arm's length basis.

### **Step-by-Step Guidance for Applying the Revaluation Model**

1. **Identify the Asset Class**: Determine which class of assets will be revalued. Ensure that all assets within the class are revalued to maintain consistency.

2. **Determine Fair Value**: Engage a qualified valuer if necessary to determine the fair value of the assets.

3. **Perform Revaluation**: Adjust the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value. Recognize any increase in revaluation surplus and any decrease in profit or loss or against any existing revaluation surplus.

4. **Adjust Depreciation**: Recalculate depreciation based on the revalued amount and the remaining useful life of the asset.

5. **Disclose Information**: Ensure all necessary disclosures are made in the financial statements, including the revaluation surplus and the methods used to determine fair value.

### **Common Pitfalls and Strategies to Overcome Them**

1. **Inconsistent Revaluation**: Ensure that all assets within a class are revalued to avoid inconsistencies.

2. **Inadequate Disclosure**: Provide comprehensive disclosures to comply with IFRS requirements and avoid regulatory issues.

3. **Incorrect Fair Value Determination**: Use qualified valuers and ensure assumptions are reasonable and based on market data.

4. **Failure to Adjust Depreciation**: Recalculate depreciation based on the revalued amount to avoid misstating expenses.

### **Real-World Applications and Implications**

The revaluation model provides a more accurate reflection of an entity's financial position by aligning asset values with current market conditions. This can enhance the credibility of financial statements and provide stakeholders with more relevant information. However, it also introduces volatility in reported earnings and equity, which must be carefully managed.

### **Conclusion**

The Revaluation Model under IFRS is a powerful tool for reflecting the true value of assets on the balance sheet. While it offers significant benefits, it also requires careful application and compliance with stringent disclosure requirements. By mastering this model, you can enhance your understanding of financial reporting and improve your performance on Canadian accounting exams.
