## 6.11 Leased Assets and Right-of-Use Assets

### Introduction to Leased Assets and Right-of-Use Assets

In recent years, the landscape of lease accounting has undergone significant transformation, primarily due to the introduction of new standards such as IFRS 16 and ASPE 3065. These standards have redefined how companies recognize and report leased assets and liabilities, emphasizing transparency and comparability in financial statements. This section will guide you through the intricacies of accounting for leased assets and right-of-use (ROU) assets, providing you with the knowledge and skills necessary to excel in the Canadian accounting exams and in professional practice.

### Understanding Lease Accounting Standards

Lease accounting standards, particularly IFRS 16, have shifted the focus from the traditional classification of leases as either operating or finance leases to a model where most leases are recognized on the balance sheet. This change aims to provide a more accurate representation of a company's financial obligations and asset utilization.

#### IFRS 16: Leases

Under IFRS 16, lessees are required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability for most lease contracts. This approach eliminates the distinction between operating and finance leases for lessees, ensuring that all lease-related assets and liabilities are reflected in the financial statements.

#### ASPE 3065: Leases

For private enterprises in Canada, ASPE 3065 provides guidance on lease accounting. While it retains the distinction between operating and capital leases, it aligns with IFRS 16 in emphasizing the recognition of lease obligations and assets.

### Key Concepts in Lease Accounting

#### Right-of-Use Asset

A right-of-use asset represents the lessee's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term. It is initially measured at cost, which includes the initial amount of the lease liability, any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, and any initial direct costs incurred by the lessee.

#### Lease Liability

The lease liability is the present value of lease payments not yet paid. It is calculated using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee's incremental borrowing rate.

#### Lease Term

The lease term is the non-cancellable period of the lease, including any optional renewal periods that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise.

### Recognition and Measurement of Leased Assets

#### Initial Recognition

At the commencement date, a lessee recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. The right-of-use asset is measured at cost, while the lease liability is measured at the present value of the lease payments.

#### Subsequent Measurement

- **Right-of-Use Asset:** The right-of-use asset is subsequently measured using the cost model, which involves depreciating the asset over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the underlying asset.
- **Lease Liability:** The lease liability is subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability and reducing it by the lease payments made.

### Practical Example: Lease Accounting

Consider a company, ABC Ltd., that enters into a five-year lease agreement for office space. The annual lease payment is $50,000, and the company's incremental borrowing rate is 5%.

#### Initial Measurement

- **Lease Liability:** Present value of lease payments = $50,000 / (1 + 0.05)^1 + $50,000 / (1 + 0.05)^2 + ... + $50,000 / (1 + 0.05)^5 = $216,471
- **Right-of-Use Asset:** Initial measurement = $216,471

#### Subsequent Measurement

- **Depreciation of Right-of-Use Asset:** $216,471 / 5 years = $43,294 per year
- **Interest on Lease Liability:** Year 1 = $216,471 * 5% = $10,824

### Presentation and Disclosure

#### Balance Sheet

- **Right-of-Use Asset:** Presented as a separate line item or included within property, plant, and equipment.
- **Lease Liability:** Presented as a separate line item, split between current and non-current liabilities.

#### Income Statement

- **Depreciation Expense:** Recognized for the right-of-use asset.
- **Interest Expense:** Recognized on the lease liability.

#### Disclosure Requirements

Companies must disclose qualitative and quantitative information about their leasing activities, including:

- A maturity analysis of lease liabilities.
- Information about variable lease payments and extension options.
- Reconciliation of opening and closing balances of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.

### Challenges and Best Practices

#### Common Pitfalls

- **Incorrect Lease Classification:** Misclassifying leases can lead to significant errors in financial reporting.
- **Inaccurate Measurement of Lease Liabilities:** Failing to accurately calculate the present value of lease payments can result in misstated liabilities.

#### Best Practices

- **Thorough Contract Review:** Carefully review lease agreements to identify all components of lease payments.
- **Regular Updates:** Regularly update lease calculations to reflect changes in lease terms or payment schedules.

### Exam Preparation Tips

- **Understand Key Concepts:** Focus on understanding the core principles of lease accounting, including the recognition and measurement of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.
- **Practice Calculations:** Work through practice problems to master the calculation of present values, depreciation, and interest expenses.
- **Stay Updated:** Keep abreast of any changes in lease accounting standards and how they impact financial reporting.

### Conclusion

Accounting for leased assets and right-of-use assets is a critical component of intermediate accounting, particularly in light of recent changes to lease accounting standards. By mastering the concepts and practices outlined in this section, you will be well-prepared to tackle lease accounting questions on the Canadian accounting exams and apply this knowledge in your professional career.

### What is the primary purpose of recognizing right-of-use assets under IFRS 16?

- [x] To reflect the lessee's right to use the underlying asset for the lease term
- [ ] To classify leases as either operating or finance leases
- [ ] To eliminate the need for lease disclosures
- [ ] To reduce the complexity of financial statements

> **Explanation:** The primary purpose of recognizing right-of-use assets under IFRS 16 is to reflect the lessee's right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, ensuring transparency in financial reporting.
