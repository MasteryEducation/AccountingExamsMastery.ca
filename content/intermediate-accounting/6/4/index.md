## 6.4 Impairment of PP&E Assets

In the realm of accounting, particularly when dealing with Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E), understanding the concept of impairment is crucial. Impairment occurs when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, necessitating a write-down to reflect the asset's true economic value. This section provides an in-depth exploration of the impairment of PP&E assets, focusing on recognition, measurement, and reporting in compliance with Canadian accounting standards.

### Understanding Impairment

Impairment is a critical concept in accounting, ensuring that the financial statements reflect the true value of an entity's assets. It prevents overstatement of asset values and ensures that the financial statements provide a fair and accurate picture of an entity's financial position.

#### Key Concepts

- **Carrying Amount:** The amount at which an asset is recognized on the balance sheet after deducting accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
- **Recoverable Amount:** The higher of an asset's fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use.
- **Impairment Loss:** The amount by which the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.

### Recognition of Impairment

The recognition of impairment involves identifying when an asset's carrying amount is no longer recoverable. This process is guided by specific indicators and triggers that suggest an asset may be impaired.

#### Indicators of Impairment

1. **External Indicators:**
   - Significant decline in market value.
   - Adverse changes in the technological, market, economic, or legal environment.
   - Increase in market interest rates affecting the discount rate used in calculating value in use.

2. **Internal Indicators:**
   - Evidence of obsolescence or physical damage.
   - Changes in the way an asset is used or expected to be used.
   - Economic performance of the asset is worse than expected.

### Measurement of Impairment

Once an impairment indicator is identified, the next step is to measure the impairment loss. This involves determining the recoverable amount of the asset and comparing it to its carrying amount.

#### Calculating Recoverable Amount

The recoverable amount is the higher of:

- **Fair Value Less Costs of Disposal (FVLCD):** The price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants, minus the costs of disposal.
- **Value in Use (VIU):** The present value of future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset.

##### Steps to Calculate Value in Use

1. **Estimate Future Cash Flows:** Consider cash inflows and outflows directly attributable to the asset.
2. **Apply an Appropriate Discount Rate:** Reflect the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.

### Impairment Loss Recognition

If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognized. This loss is recorded in the income statement and reduces the carrying amount of the asset on the balance sheet.

### Reversal of Impairment Losses

Under certain circumstances, impairment losses can be reversed. This is applicable when there is an indication that the impairment loss recognized in prior periods may no longer exist or may have decreased.

#### Conditions for Reversal

- Changes in estimates used to determine the asset's recoverable amount.
- Improvement in market conditions or the asset's use.

### Impairment Testing: Practical Example

Consider a manufacturing company with a piece of machinery that has a carrying amount of $500,000. Due to technological advancements, the machinery's market value has declined significantly. The company estimates the machinery's fair value less costs of disposal at $350,000 and its value in use at $400,000.

- **Recoverable Amount:** $400,000 (higher of FVLCD and VIU)
- **Impairment Loss:** $500,000 (carrying amount) - $400,000 (recoverable amount) = $100,000

The company would recognize an impairment loss of $100,000.

### Regulatory Framework

In Canada, the impairment of PP&E is governed by the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the Canadian Accounting Standards Board (AcSB). The relevant standard is IAS 36, "Impairment of Assets."

#### Key Provisions of IAS 36

- **Scope:** Applies to all assets except inventories, deferred tax assets, assets arising from employee benefits, and financial assets.
- **Frequency of Testing:** Annual impairment testing for intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and goodwill.
- **Disclosure Requirements:** Details of impairment losses and reversals, including the events leading to impairment and the assumptions used in calculating recoverable amounts.

### Impairment under ASPE

For private enterprises in Canada, the Accounting Standards for Private Enterprises (ASPE) provide guidance on impairment. Section 3063, "Impairment of Long-Lived Assets," outlines the requirements for recognizing and measuring impairment.

#### Differences between IFRS and ASPE

- **Frequency of Testing:** ASPE does not require annual testing for all assets, focusing on indicators of impairment.
- **Reversal of Impairment:** ASPE does not allow the reversal of impairment losses.

### Real-World Applications and Challenges

Impairment testing can be complex, involving significant judgment and estimation. Factors such as market volatility, technological changes, and economic conditions can impact the assessment of impairment.

#### Common Challenges

- **Estimating Future Cash Flows:** Requires assumptions about future market conditions and asset usage.
- **Determining Discount Rates:** Must reflect the risks specific to the asset.
- **Identifying Impairment Indicators:** Requires ongoing monitoring of both internal and external factors.

### Best Practices for Impairment Testing

- **Regular Monitoring:** Continuously assess both internal and external indicators of impairment.
- **Documentation:** Maintain thorough documentation of assumptions and calculations used in impairment testing.
- **Use of Experts:** Consider engaging valuation experts for complex assets or when significant judgment is involved.

### Case Study: Impairment in the Retail Sector

A retail company faces declining sales due to increased competition and changing consumer preferences. The company conducts an impairment test on its store locations, considering factors such as reduced foot traffic and decreased profitability.

- **Outcome:** Several store locations are found to be impaired, leading to a write-down of their carrying amounts.
- **Impact:** The impairment loss affects the company's financial statements, highlighting the need for strategic adjustments in operations.

### Conclusion

Understanding and applying the principles of impairment for PP&E assets is essential for accurate financial reporting and compliance with Canadian accounting standards. By recognizing impairment indicators, accurately measuring recoverable amounts, and adhering to regulatory requirements, accountants can ensure that financial statements reflect the true economic value of an entity's assets.
