## 16.3 Preparing the Statement Using the Direct Method

The statement of cash flows is a crucial financial statement that provides insights into a company's cash inflows and outflows over a specific period. It helps stakeholders understand how a company generates and uses cash, which is vital for assessing liquidity, financial flexibility, and overall financial health. The direct method of preparing the statement of cash flows is one of the two primary methods recognized under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Accounting Standards for Private Enterprises (ASPE) in Canada. This method provides a clear view of cash transactions by reporting major classes of gross cash receipts and payments.

### Understanding the Direct Method

The direct method involves listing all major operating cash receipts and payments, providing a straightforward view of cash flows from operating activities. Unlike the indirect method, which adjusts net income for non-cash transactions, the direct method focuses on actual cash transactions. This method is preferred by many users of financial statements as it provides more detailed information about cash flows.

#### Key Components of the Direct Method

1. **Cash Receipts from Customers**: This includes all cash received from customers for goods sold or services rendered.
2. **Cash Payments to Suppliers**: This includes cash paid to suppliers for inventory and other operating expenses.
3. **Cash Payments to Employees**: This includes salaries, wages, and other employee-related expenses paid in cash.
4. **Cash Payments for Other Operating Expenses**: This includes cash paid for various operating expenses such as rent, utilities, and insurance.
5. **Cash Payments for Interest and Taxes**: This includes cash paid for interest on debt and income taxes.

### Steps to Prepare the Statement Using the Direct Method

#### Step 1: Gather Necessary Information

To prepare the statement of cash flows using the direct method, you will need the following information:

- **Income Statement**: To identify revenue and expense items.
- **Balance Sheet**: To determine changes in accounts that affect cash flow.
- **Additional Information**: Such as notes to the financial statements that provide details on non-cash transactions and other relevant data.

#### Step 2: Calculate Cash Receipts from Customers

Cash receipts from customers can be calculated using the following formula:

{{< katex >}} \text{Cash Receipts from Customers} = \text{Sales Revenue} + \text{Decrease in Accounts Receivable} - \text{Increase in Accounts Receivable} {{< /katex >}}

This calculation adjusts sales revenue for changes in accounts receivable to reflect the actual cash received.

#### Step 3: Calculate Cash Payments to Suppliers

Cash payments to suppliers can be calculated using the following formula:

{{< katex >}} \text{Cash Payments to Suppliers} = \text{Cost of Goods Sold} + \text{Increase in Inventory} - \text{Decrease in Inventory} + \text{Decrease in Accounts Payable} - \text{Increase in Accounts Payable} {{< /katex >}}

This formula adjusts the cost of goods sold for changes in inventory and accounts payable to determine the actual cash paid to suppliers.

#### Step 4: Calculate Cash Payments to Employees

Cash payments to employees are typically straightforward and can be obtained directly from the payroll records. Ensure that all employee-related expenses paid in cash are included.

#### Step 5: Calculate Cash Payments for Other Operating Expenses

Other operating expenses can be calculated by adjusting the expenses reported on the income statement for changes in related prepaid expenses and accrued liabilities.

#### Step 6: Calculate Cash Payments for Interest and Taxes

Interest and tax payments can be calculated by adjusting the interest and tax expenses reported on the income statement for changes in related payable accounts.

### Practical Example: Preparing a Cash Flow Statement Using the Direct Method

Let's consider a practical example to illustrate the preparation of a cash flow statement using the direct method.

**Example Company: ABC Manufacturing Ltd.**

**Income Statement for the Year Ended December 31, 2023:**

- Sales Revenue: $500,000
- Cost of Goods Sold: $300,000
- Operating Expenses: $100,000
- Interest Expense: $10,000
- Income Tax Expense: $20,000

**Balance Sheet Extracts:**

- Accounts Receivable: Beginning $50,000, Ending $40,000
- Inventory: Beginning $60,000, Ending $70,000
- Accounts Payable: Beginning $30,000, Ending $20,000
- Interest Payable: Beginning $5,000, Ending $3,000
- Income Taxes Payable: Beginning $8,000, Ending $6,000

**Step-by-Step Calculation:**

1. **Cash Receipts from Customers:**

   {{< katex >}}
   \begin{align*}
   \text{Sales Revenue} & = \$500,000 \\
   \text{Decrease in Accounts Receivable} & = \$50,000 - \$40,000 = \$10,000 \\
   \text{Cash Receipts from Customers} & = \$500,000 + \$10,000 = \$510,000 \\
   \end{align*}
   {{< /katex >}}

2. **Cash Payments to Suppliers:**

   {{< katex >}}
   \begin{align*}
   \text{Cost of Goods Sold} & = \$300,000 \\
   \text{Increase in Inventory} & = \$70,000 - \$60,000 = \$10,000 \\
   \text{Decrease in Accounts Payable} & = \$30,000 - \$20,000 = \$10,000 \\
   \text{Cash Payments to Suppliers} & = \$300,000 + \$10,000 + \$10,000 = \$320,000 \\
   \end{align*}
   {{< /katex >}}

3. **Cash Payments to Employees:**

   Assuming all operating expenses are cash-based, cash payments to employees are included in operating expenses.

4. **Cash Payments for Other Operating Expenses:**

   {{< katex >}}
   \text{Operating Expenses} = \$100,000
   {{< /katex >}}

5. **Cash Payments for Interest:**

   {{< katex >}}
   \begin{align*}
   \text{Interest Expense} & = \$10,000 \\
   \text{Decrease in Interest Payable} & = \$5,000 - \$3,000 = \$2,000 \\
   \text{Cash Payments for Interest} & = \$10,000 + \$2,000 = \$12,000 \\
   \end{align*}
   {{< /katex >}}

6. **Cash Payments for Taxes:**

   {{< katex >}}
   \begin{align*}
   \text{Income Tax Expense} & = \$20,000 \\
   \text{Decrease in Income Taxes Payable} & = \$8,000 - \$6,000 = \$2,000 \\
   \text{Cash Payments for Taxes} & = \$20,000 + \$2,000 = \$22,000 \\
   \end{align*}
   {{< /katex >}}
