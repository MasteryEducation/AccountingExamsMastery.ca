## 13.10 Disclosure Requirements for Leases

In the realm of accounting, transparency and clarity in financial reporting are paramount. This is especially true for lease accounting, where both lessees and lessors must adhere to stringent disclosure requirements. These disclosures provide stakeholders with essential information to assess the financial implications of lease agreements on an entity's financial position and performance. In this section, we will delve into the disclosure requirements for leases, focusing on both lessees and lessors, under the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Accounting Standards for Private Enterprises (ASPE) as adopted in Canada.

### Understanding Lease Disclosure Requirements

Lease disclosures are designed to provide users of financial statements with a comprehensive understanding of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. This involves both qualitative and quantitative information, which must be presented in a manner that is clear and understandable.

#### Objectives of Lease Disclosures

1. **Transparency**: Enhance the transparency of financial statements by providing detailed information about lease transactions.
2. **Comparability**: Enable users to compare financial statements across different entities and periods.
3. **Decision-Making**: Equip stakeholders with the necessary information to make informed decisions regarding the entity's financial health and operational efficiency.

### Lessee Disclosure Requirements

Under IFRS 16, lessees are required to disclose a variety of information that provides insights into their leasing activities. These disclosures are categorized into qualitative and quantitative information.

#### Qualitative Disclosures

Qualitative disclosures provide narrative descriptions and explanations about the entity's leasing activities. Key qualitative disclosures include:

- **Nature of Leasing Activities**: A description of the leasing arrangements, including the basis on which variable lease payments are determined, the existence of extension or termination options, and any restrictions or covenants imposed by leases.
- **Significant Judgments and Assumptions**: Information about significant judgments made in applying lease accounting policies, such as determining whether a contract contains a lease, the lease term, and the discount rate used.
- **Lease Modifications**: Details about any lease modifications during the reporting period and how these have been accounted for.

#### Quantitative Disclosures

Quantitative disclosures provide numerical data about the financial impact of leases. Key quantitative disclosures include:

- **Lease Liabilities**: The carrying amount of lease liabilities, with a breakdown of current and non-current portions.
- **Right-of-Use Assets**: The carrying amount of right-of-use assets, by class of underlying asset.
- **Maturity Analysis**: A maturity analysis of lease liabilities, showing the undiscounted cash flows to be paid on an annual basis.
- **Expense Recognition**: The total cash outflow for leases, expenses related to short-term leases, low-value asset leases, and variable lease payments not included in the lease liability.
- **Reconciliation**: A reconciliation of the opening and closing balances of lease liabilities.

#### Practical Example for Lessees

Consider a Canadian company, MapleTech Inc., which leases office space and equipment. The company must disclose the following:

- **Qualitative**: MapleTech Inc. leases office space under a 10-year non-cancellable lease with an option to extend for an additional 5 years. The lease payments are indexed to inflation.
- **Quantitative**: The lease liability for the office space is $500,000, with $100,000 due within the next 12 months. The right-of-use asset for the office space is $480,000.

### Lessor Disclosure Requirements

Lessors, under IFRS 16, also have specific disclosure requirements aimed at providing insights into their leasing activities. These disclosures are similarly divided into qualitative and quantitative information.

#### Qualitative Disclosures

Qualitative disclosures for lessors include:

- **Nature of Leasing Activities**: A description of the leasing arrangements, including the basis on which variable lease payments are determined and any significant changes in the carrying amount of the net investment in leases.
- **Risk Management**: Information about how the lessor manages risks associated with residual values of leased assets.

#### Quantitative Disclosures

Quantitative disclosures for lessors include:

- **Lease Income**: The total lease income recognized during the reporting period, with a breakdown of income from finance leases and operating leases.
- **Net Investment in Leases**: The carrying amount of the net investment in finance leases, with a maturity analysis of the lease payments receivable.
- **Operating Lease Assets**: The carrying amount of assets subject to operating leases, by class of underlying asset.

#### Practical Example for Lessors

Consider a Canadian real estate company, Northern Properties Ltd., which leases commercial properties. The company must disclose the following:

- **Qualitative**: Northern Properties Ltd. leases commercial properties under operating leases with terms ranging from 5 to 15 years. The lease payments are fixed with no variable components.
- **Quantitative**: The total lease income from operating leases is $1,200,000 for the year. The carrying amount of properties leased under operating leases is $10,000,000.

### Compliance with ASPE

For entities reporting under ASPE, the disclosure requirements for leases are outlined in Section 3065. While similar to IFRS, there are some differences in the level of detail and specific requirements.

#### Key ASPE Disclosures

- **Lease Obligations**: Disclosure of the total future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable leases.
- **Lease Income**: Disclosure of total lease income and a description of the lessor's leasing arrangements.
- **Contingent Rents**: Disclosure of contingent rents recognized as income during the period.

### Challenges and Best Practices

#### Common Challenges

1. **Complexity of Lease Agreements**: Understanding and interpreting complex lease agreements can be challenging, especially when determining lease terms and discount rates.
2. **Judgment and Estimates**: Significant judgments and estimates are required in lease accounting, which can lead to variability in financial reporting.

#### Best Practices

1. **Regular Training**: Ensure that accounting personnel are regularly trained on the latest lease accounting standards and disclosure requirements.
2. **Robust Systems**: Implement robust systems and processes to accurately capture and report lease-related information.
3. **Clear Communication**: Maintain clear communication with stakeholders about the impact of leases on financial statements.

### Regulatory Considerations

In Canada, the adoption of IFRS and ASPE standards is overseen by the Accounting Standards Board (AcSB). Entities must ensure compliance with these standards to avoid regulatory penalties and maintain investor confidence.

#### IFRS vs. ASPE

- **IFRS**: Provides a more comprehensive framework for lease disclosures, with detailed requirements for both lessees and lessors.
- **ASPE**: Offers a simplified approach, suitable for private enterprises, with less detailed disclosure requirements.

### Conclusion

Disclosure requirements for leases play a crucial role in enhancing the transparency and comparability of financial statements. By providing detailed qualitative and quantitative information, entities can offer stakeholders a clear view of their leasing activities and their impact on financial performance. As accounting standards continue to evolve, it is essential for entities to stay informed and ensure compliance with the latest disclosure requirements.
