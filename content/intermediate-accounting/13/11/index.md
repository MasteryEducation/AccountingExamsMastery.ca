## 13.11 Leveraged Leases

Leveraged leases are a sophisticated form of lease arrangement that involves multiple parties, including a lessor, a lessee, and a third-party lender. These leases are commonly used for financing large capital assets and are characterized by the lessor borrowing a significant portion of the purchase price of the leased asset from a lender. This section will delve into the intricacies of leveraged leases, their accounting treatment, and the implications for financial reporting under Canadian accounting standards.

### Understanding Leveraged Leases

Leveraged leases are a type of finance lease where the lessor finances the acquisition of the leased asset through a combination of equity and debt. The debt portion is typically non-recourse, meaning the lender's claim is limited to the leased asset and the lease payments, without recourse to the lessor's other assets. This arrangement allows the lessor to leverage the asset, hence the name "leveraged lease."

#### Key Characteristics of Leveraged Leases

1. **Multiple Parties Involved:**
   - **Lessor:** Owns the asset and leases it to the lessee.
   - **Lessee:** Uses the asset and makes lease payments to the lessor.
   - **Lender:** Provides financing to the lessor, secured by the leased asset and lease payments.

2. **Non-Recourse Debt:**
   - The lender's recourse is limited to the leased asset and the lease payments, reducing the lessor's risk.

3. **Tax Benefits:**
   - Leveraged leases often provide tax benefits to the lessor, who can claim depreciation and interest deductions.

4. **Complex Structuring:**
   - These leases involve intricate legal and financial structuring, often requiring specialized knowledge.

### Accounting for Leveraged Leases

The accounting treatment for leveraged leases can be complex due to the involvement of multiple parties and the unique financial arrangements. Under Canadian accounting standards, the treatment of leveraged leases is guided by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Accounting Standards for Private Enterprises (ASPE).

#### Lessor Accounting

For the lessor, a leveraged lease is typically treated as a finance lease. The lessor recognizes the lease receivable and derecognizes the leased asset. The lease receivable is measured at the present value of the lease payments, discounted at the interest rate implicit in the lease.

**Key Steps for Lessor Accounting:**

1. **Initial Recognition:**
   - Recognize the lease receivable at the present value of lease payments.
   - Derecognize the leased asset from the balance sheet.

2. **Subsequent Measurement:**
   - Recognize interest income over the lease term using the interest rate implicit in the lease.

3. **Tax Implications:**
   - Account for tax benefits, such as depreciation and interest deductions.

#### Lessee Accounting

For the lessee, a leveraged lease is accounted for similarly to other finance leases. The lessee recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the commencement date of the lease.

**Key Steps for Lessee Accounting:**

1. **Initial Recognition:**
   - Recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the present value of lease payments.

2. **Subsequent Measurement:**
   - Amortize the right-of-use asset over the lease term.
   - Recognize interest expense on the lease liability.

3. **Disclosure Requirements:**
   - Provide detailed disclosures about the lease terms, payments, and any significant judgments made.

### Practical Example of a Leveraged Lease

Consider a Canadian company, Maple Manufacturing Inc., that enters into a leveraged lease to acquire a new piece of manufacturing equipment. The equipment costs $10 million, and the lessor, Northern Leasing Corp., finances 70% of the cost through a non-recourse loan from a bank.

**Lease Terms:**
- Lease Term: 10 years
- Annual Lease Payment: $1.2 million
- Interest Rate Implicit in the Lease: 6%

**Accounting Treatment:**

- **Lessor (Northern Leasing Corp.):**
  - Recognizes a lease receivable at the present value of $1.2 million annual payments, discounted at 6%.
  - Derecognizes the equipment from its balance sheet.
  - Recognizes interest income over the lease term.

- **Lessee (Maple Manufacturing Inc.):**
  - Recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the present value of $1.2 million annual payments, discounted at 6%.
  - Amortizes the right-of-use asset over 10 years.
  - Recognizes interest expense on the lease liability.

### Regulatory Considerations and Compliance

Leveraged leases must comply with Canadian accounting standards, including IFRS and ASPE. These standards provide guidance on the recognition, measurement, and disclosure of lease transactions.

#### IFRS 16: Leases

Under IFRS 16, lessees are required to recognize most leases on the balance sheet, providing greater transparency. For lessors, the standard retains a dual model, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases.

#### ASPE Section 3065: Leases

ASPE Section 3065 provides guidance for private enterprises in Canada. It allows for a similar classification of leases as IFRS but with some differences in recognition and measurement.

### Challenges and Best Practices

Leveraged leases present several challenges, including complex structuring, tax implications, and compliance with accounting standards. Here are some best practices to consider:

1. **Engage Experts:**
   - Work with legal and financial experts to structure the lease arrangement.

2. **Understand Tax Implications:**
   - Analyze the tax benefits and implications of the lease arrangement.

3. **Ensure Compliance:**
   - Stay updated with changes in accounting standards and ensure compliance.

4. **Detailed Disclosures:**
   - Provide comprehensive disclosures in financial statements to enhance transparency.

### Conclusion

Leveraged leases are a powerful tool for financing large capital assets, offering benefits such as tax advantages and risk reduction. However, they require careful structuring and compliance with accounting standards. Understanding the intricacies of leveraged leases is crucial for accountants and financial professionals, especially those preparing for Canadian accounting exams.
