## 13.4 Lessor Accounting: Operating and Finance Leases

In the world of accounting, leases play a significant role in how companies manage their assets and liabilities. For lessors, understanding the classification and accounting treatment of leases is crucial to accurately reflect financial performance and position. This section delves into the accounting for lessors under both operating and finance leases, focusing on the standards applicable in Canada, including IFRS 16 and ASPE.

### **Understanding Lease Classification**

Lease classification is the first step in lessor accounting. The classification determines how the lease will be recognized and measured in the financial statements. Under IFRS 16, a lessor must classify each lease as either an operating lease or a finance lease. The classification is based on the extent to which the lease transfers the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an underlying asset.

#### **Finance Lease**

A lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset. Indicators of a finance lease include:

- **Transfer of Ownership:** The lease transfers ownership of the asset to the lessee by the end of the lease term.
- **Bargain Purchase Option:** The lessee has the option to purchase the asset at a price significantly lower than its fair value.
- **Lease Term:** The lease term covers the major part of the economic life of the asset.
- **Present Value of Lease Payments:** The present value of the lease payments amounts to substantially all of the fair value of the asset.
- **Specialized Nature:** The asset is of such a specialized nature that only the lessee can use it without major modifications.

#### **Operating Lease**

If a lease does not meet the criteria for a finance lease, it is classified as an operating lease. Operating leases do not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership.

### **Accounting for Finance Leases**

When a lessor classifies a lease as a finance lease, the accounting treatment involves recognizing a receivable at the commencement date. This receivable represents the lessor's net investment in the lease.

#### **Initial Recognition**

At the commencement of the lease, the lessor recognizes:

- **Lease Receivable:** The present value of the lease payments to be received, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease.
- **Derecognition of Asset:** The underlying asset is derecognized from the lessor's balance sheet.

#### **Subsequent Measurement**

The lease receivable is subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Interest income is recognized over the lease term, reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the lessor's net investment.

#### **Example: Finance Lease Accounting**

Consider a lessor leasing a piece of equipment with a fair value of $100,000. The lease term is 5 years, with annual lease payments of $22,000. The interest rate implicit in the lease is 5%.

- **Initial Measurement:**
  - Lease Receivable: Present value of $22,000 annual payments over 5 years at 5% = $95,000
  - Derecognize Equipment: $100,000

- **Subsequent Measurement:**
  - Recognize interest income each year using the effective interest method.

### **Accounting for Operating Leases**

For operating leases, the lessor retains the asset on its balance sheet and recognizes lease income over the lease term.

#### **Initial Recognition**

The lessor continues to recognize the underlying asset in its balance sheet and depreciates it over its useful life.

#### **Lease Income Recognition**

Lease income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which benefit derived from the leased asset is diminished.

#### **Example: Operating Lease Accounting**

Assume a lessor leases office space with an annual lease payment of $10,000 for 3 years.

- **Initial Recognition:**
  - Retain the office space as an asset on the balance sheet.

- **Income Recognition:**
  - Recognize $10,000 as lease income each year.

### **Disclosure Requirements**

Both IFRS 16 and ASPE require lessors to provide disclosures that enable users of financial statements to assess the effect that leases have on the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of the entity.

#### **Key Disclosures for Finance Leases**

- **Net Investment in Leases:** The carrying amount of the net investment in finance leases at the end of the reporting period.
- **Maturity Analysis:** A maturity analysis of lease payments receivable, showing the undiscounted cash flows.
- **Interest Income:** The amount of interest income recognized during the period.

#### **Key Disclosures for Operating Leases**

- **Lease Income:** The total amount of lease income recognized during the period.
- **Future Lease Payments:** A maturity analysis of future lease payments receivable.

### **Practical Considerations and Challenges**

#### **Lease Modifications**

Lease modifications can change the classification of a lease. Lessors need to reassess the classification and adjust accounting treatment accordingly.

#### **Impairment of Lease Receivables**

Lessors must assess lease receivables for impairment, recognizing any expected credit losses.

#### **Regulatory Compliance**

Lessors must ensure compliance with Canadian accounting standards, including IFRS 16 and ASPE, and stay updated on any amendments or interpretations.

### **Real-World Application and Case Studies**

#### **Case Study: Equipment Leasing Company**

An equipment leasing company classifies its leases based on the criteria outlined in IFRS 16. The company uses a systematic approach to assess whether the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the lessee. This involves evaluating the lease term, the present value of lease payments, and any purchase options.

#### **Case Study: Real Estate Lessor**

A real estate company leases commercial properties under operating leases. The company recognizes lease income on a straight-line basis, ensuring that financial statements reflect a consistent income stream over the lease term.

### **Conclusion**

Understanding lessor accounting for operating and finance leases is essential for accurate financial reporting and compliance with Canadian accounting standards. By classifying leases correctly and following the appropriate accounting treatment, lessors can provide transparent and reliable financial information to stakeholders.
