## 14.3.5 Cloud Computing

Cloud computing has emerged as a transformative force in the accounting profession, offering unprecedented opportunities for efficiency, scalability, and innovation. As a CPA candidate, understanding the implications and applications of cloud computing is essential for both the CPA exam and your future career. This section will delve into the fundamentals of cloud computing, its benefits and challenges, and its impact on accounting practices.

### Understanding Cloud Computing

Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics—over the internet ("the cloud"). This technology allows businesses to access and store data on remote servers rather than on local servers or personal computers. 

#### Key Characteristics of Cloud Computing

1. **On-Demand Self-Service:** Users can access computing resources as needed without requiring human interaction with service providers.
2. **Broad Network Access:** Services are available over the network and can be accessed through standard mechanisms by various platforms (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations).
3. **Resource Pooling:** Computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to demand.
4. **Rapid Elasticity:** Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand.
5. **Measured Service:** Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service.

### Types of Cloud Services
