## 25.3.1 Key Definitions

Understanding key accounting terms and concepts is crucial for success in the Chartered Professional Accountant (CPA) exam. This section provides a comprehensive glossary of essential definitions, practical examples, and real-world applications to help you master the material and excel in your exam preparation.

### Accounting Principles and Concepts

**Accrual Accounting:** A method of accounting where revenues and expenses are recorded when they are earned or incurred, regardless of when the cash is actually received or paid. This principle ensures that financial statements reflect the true financial position of a company.

*Example:* A company delivers goods in December but receives payment in January. Under accrual accounting, the revenue is recorded in December.

**Matching Principle:** This principle dictates that expenses should be recorded in the same period as the revenues they help to generate. This ensures that financial statements accurately reflect the profitability of a company.

*Example:* If a company incurs advertising expenses in December to boost December sales, those expenses should be recorded in December, even if the payment is made in January.

**Going Concern:** An assumption that a company will continue to operate indefinitely and not go bankrupt or be liquidated in the foreseeable future. This assumption underpins the preparation of financial statements.

*Example:* A company with significant debt but a strong market position may still be considered a going concern if it can meet its obligations.

### Financial Reporting

**International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS):** A set of accounting standards developed by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) that provide guidelines for financial reporting. IFRS is used in over 140 countries, including Canada.

*Example:* IFRS 15 outlines the principles for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers.

**Accounting Standards for Private Enterprises (ASPE):** A set of standards issued by the Canadian Accounting Standards Board (AcSB) for private enterprises in Canada. ASPE provides a simplified framework compared to IFRS.

*Example:* ASPE Section 3856 deals with financial instruments and their measurement.

**Public Sector Accounting Standards (PSAS):** Standards used by public sector entities in Canada to prepare their financial statements. These standards ensure transparency and accountability in public financial reporting.

*Example:* PSAS 1201 outlines the presentation of financial statements for public sector entities.

### Audit and Assurance

**Audit Risk:** The risk that an auditor may unknowingly fail to appropriately modify their opinion on financial statements that are materially misstated. Audit risk is composed of inherent risk, control risk, and detection risk.

*Example:* A high level of complexity in financial transactions increases inherent risk, which in turn affects audit risk.

**Materiality:** A concept in auditing that refers to the significance of an amount, transaction, or discrepancy. An item is considered material if its omission or misstatement could influence the economic decisions of users of the financial statements.

*Example:* A $10,000 error in a company with $1 million in revenue may be material, whereas the same error in a company with $100 million in revenue may not be.

**Assurance Engagements:** Professional services provided by accountants to improve the quality of information for decision-makers. These engagements include audits, reviews, and other assurance services.

*Example:* A review engagement provides limited assurance that financial statements are free from material misstatement.

### Management Accounting
