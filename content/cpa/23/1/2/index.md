## 23.1.2 Verifiable vs. Non-Verifiable Activities

Continuing Professional Development (CPD) is a cornerstone of maintaining the Chartered Professional Accountant (CPA) designation in Canada. It ensures that CPAs remain competent, ethical, and up-to-date with the latest developments in the accounting profession. Within the CPD framework, activities are categorized into two main types: verifiable and non-verifiable. Understanding the distinctions between these types is crucial for CPAs to meet their professional obligations and to continue delivering high-quality services.

### Understanding CPD Requirements

CPD requirements are set by CPA Canada and its provincial bodies to ensure that all CPAs engage in lifelong learning. These requirements are designed to enhance professional competence and ensure that CPAs remain relevant in a rapidly changing business environment. CPD activities can include formal education, informal learning, and practical experience, all contributing to a CPA's professional growth.

### Verifiable CPD Activities

**Definition:** Verifiable CPD activities are those that can be objectively confirmed by a third party. These activities typically involve structured learning and are often accompanied by documentation or evidence that can be reviewed or audited.

#### Characteristics of Verifiable Activities

1. **Objective Evidence:** Verifiable activities must have supporting documentation that proves participation and learning. This could include certificates of completion, transcripts, attendance records, or published work.

2. **Structured Learning:** These activities are usually part of a formal program or course, such as workshops, seminars, conferences, or university courses.

3. **Relevance to Professional Role:** The activity must be relevant to the CPA's current or future professional responsibilities and contribute to their competence.

4. **Third-Party Confirmation:** A third party, such as an educational institution or professional organization, must be able to confirm the CPA's participation and the learning outcomes.

#### Examples of Verifiable Activities

- **Professional Courses and Workshops:** Attending a course on the latest International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) updates.
- **Conferences and Seminars:** Participating in a national accounting conference where attendance is recorded.
- **Formal Education Programs:** Completing a university degree or certification program relevant to accounting.
- **Published Work:** Writing articles or papers for professional journals that are peer-reviewed.
- **Webinars and Online Courses:** Engaging in online learning platforms that provide certificates of completion.

#### Best Practices for Verifiable Activities

- **Maintain Documentation:** Keep detailed records of all verifiable activities, including certificates, agendas, and notes.
- **Align with Career Goals:** Choose activities that align with your career objectives and areas where you need to enhance your skills.
- **Plan Ahead:** Schedule verifiable activities throughout the year to ensure you meet the required CPD hours.

### Non-Verifiable CPD Activities

**Definition:** Non-verifiable CPD activities are those that do not have objective evidence to support the learning. These activities are often informal and self-directed, focusing on personal development and knowledge enhancement.

#### Characteristics of Non-Verifiable Activities

1. **Self-Directed Learning:** These activities are often initiated by the individual and do not involve formal instruction or assessment.

2. **Lack of Documentation:** There is no third-party confirmation or documentation to verify participation or learning outcomes.

3. **Personal Development Focus:** These activities are typically aimed at personal growth and may not directly relate to specific professional competencies.

#### Examples of Non-Verifiable Activities

- **Reading Professional Journals:** Keeping up-to-date with the latest industry trends through journals and magazines.
- **Self-Study:** Engaging in self-directed learning on topics of interest or relevance to your career.
- **Informal Networking:** Participating in informal discussions with peers or mentors about industry developments.
- **On-the-Job Learning:** Gaining new skills or knowledge through day-to-day work experiences.

#### Best Practices for Non-Verifiable Activities

- **Reflect on Learning:** Regularly reflect on what you have learned from non-verifiable activities and how it applies to your professional role.
- **Balance with Verifiable Activities:** Ensure a balanced approach to CPD by combining non-verifiable activities with verifiable ones.
- **Document Reflections:** Keep a journal or log of your non-verifiable learning experiences and reflections.

### Balancing Verifiable and Non-Verifiable CPD

CPAs are required to complete a certain number of CPD hours annually, with a portion of these hours needing to be verifiable. The balance between verifiable and non-verifiable activities allows CPAs to engage in both structured learning and informal development.

#### Strategies for Balancing CPD Activities

1. **Set Clear Goals:** Define your CPD goals at the beginning of the year, focusing on areas where you need to improve or expand your skills.

2. **Create a CPD Plan:** Develop a CPD plan that outlines the activities you will undertake, ensuring a mix of verifiable and non-verifiable activities.

3. **Monitor Progress:** Regularly review your CPD activities to ensure you are on track to meet the required hours and learning objectives.

4. **Seek Feedback:** Engage with peers or mentors to gain feedback on your CPD activities and identify areas for further development.

### Regulatory Considerations and Compliance

CPAs must adhere to the CPD requirements set by their provincial or regional CPA body. These requirements may vary, so it is important to be familiar with the specific regulations applicable to your jurisdiction.

#### Key Compliance Points

- **Annual Reporting:** CPAs must report their CPD activities annually, demonstrating compliance with the required hours and balance between verifiable and non-verifiable activities.
- **Documentation Retention:** Maintain records of verifiable activities for a specified period, as required by your CPA body, to provide evidence of compliance if audited.
- **Ethical Considerations:** Ensure that all CPD activities are conducted ethically and contribute to your professional competence and integrity.

### Real-World Applications and Case Studies

To illustrate the importance of CPD and the distinction between verifiable and non-verifiable activities, consider the following scenarios:

#### Case Study 1: Transitioning to a New Role

A CPA transitioning from a financial analyst to a managerial position may engage in verifiable activities such as leadership workshops and management courses. Non-verifiable activities might include reading books on leadership and participating in informal mentoring sessions.

#### Case Study 2: Staying Current with Industry Changes

A CPA specializing in tax may attend verifiable seminars on new tax legislation and engage in non-verifiable activities like reading tax law updates and discussing implications with colleagues.

### Conclusion

Understanding the difference between verifiable and non-verifiable CPD activities is essential for CPAs to meet their professional development requirements. By engaging in a balanced mix of both types of activities, CPAs can enhance their skills, stay current with industry changes, and maintain their professional competence.
