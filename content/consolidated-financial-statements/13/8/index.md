## 13.8 Practical Examples of Measurement Period Adjustments

In the realm of consolidated financial statements and business combinations, measurement period adjustments play a crucial role in ensuring that financial information is accurate and reflective of the true economic circumstances surrounding a business combination. This section will delve into practical examples of measurement period adjustments, illustrating their application in real-world scenarios and providing insights that are essential for both exam preparation and professional practice in the Canadian accounting landscape.

### Understanding Measurement Period Adjustments

Before diving into practical examples, it is important to understand what measurement period adjustments entail. When a business combination occurs, the acquirer may not have complete information about the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, or any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date. IFRS 3 and ASC 805 allow for a measurement period, which is the period after the acquisition date during which the acquirer may adjust the provisional amounts recognized for a business combination.

The measurement period cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date, and adjustments are made retrospectively. This means that the financial statements for the period in which the acquisition occurred are adjusted as if the new information had been available at the acquisition date.

### Practical Example 1: Acquisition of a Technology Firm

**Scenario:**

Company A, a Canadian technology company, acquires Company B, a smaller tech firm, on January 1, 2023. At the acquisition date, Company A provisionally recognizes the fair value of Company B's intangible assets, including patents and software, at $5 million. However, during the measurement period, Company A obtains additional information indicating that the fair value of these intangible assets should be $7 million.

**Accounting Treatment:**

1. **Initial Recognition:**
   - At acquisition, the intangible assets are recorded at $5 million.

2. **Measurement Period Adjustment:**
   - Upon obtaining new information, Company A adjusts the fair value of the intangible assets to $7 million.
   - The adjustment is made retrospectively, affecting the financial statements as of the acquisition date.

3. **Journal Entry:**
   - Debit: Intangible Assets $2 million
   - Credit: Goodwill $2 million

**Impact:**

This adjustment increases the intangible assets on the balance sheet and reduces goodwill. The retrospective adjustment ensures that the financial statements accurately reflect the fair value of the assets as of the acquisition date.

### Practical Example 2: Acquisition of a Manufacturing Company

**Scenario:**

Company X acquires Company Y, a manufacturing firm, on June 30, 2023. At the acquisition date, Company X estimates the fair value of Company Y's inventory at $3 million. However, during the measurement period, Company X discovers that the inventory includes obsolete items, and the fair value should be adjusted to $2.5 million.

**Accounting Treatment:**

1. **Initial Recognition:**
   - Inventory is recorded at $3 million at the acquisition date.

2. **Measurement Period Adjustment:**
   - The fair value of the inventory is adjusted to $2.5 million based on new information.
   - The adjustment is made retrospectively.

3. **Journal Entry:**
   - Debit: Goodwill $0.5 million
   - Credit: Inventory $0.5 million

**Impact:**

The adjustment decreases the inventory value and increases goodwill. This ensures that the financial statements reflect the true economic value of the inventory at the acquisition date.

### Practical Example 3: Acquisition of a Retail Chain

**Scenario:**

Company M acquires Company N, a retail chain, on March 1, 2023. At the acquisition date, Company M estimates the fair value of Company N's lease liabilities at $1 million. During the measurement period, Company M obtains new information indicating that the fair value of the lease liabilities should be $1.2 million.

**Accounting Treatment:**

1. **Initial Recognition:**
   - Lease liabilities are recorded at $1 million at the acquisition date.

2. **Measurement Period Adjustment:**
   - The fair value of the lease liabilities is adjusted to $1.2 million.
   - The adjustment is made retrospectively.

3. **Journal Entry:**
   - Debit: Goodwill $0.2 million
   - Credit: Lease Liabilities $0.2 million

**Impact:**

This adjustment increases the lease liabilities and goodwill. The retrospective adjustment ensures the financial statements accurately reflect the fair value of the lease liabilities as of the acquisition date.

### Practical Example 4: Acquisition of a Healthcare Provider

**Scenario:**

Company P acquires Company Q, a healthcare provider, on September 15, 2023. At the acquisition date, Company P estimates the fair value of Company Q's contingent liabilities at $500,000. During the measurement period, Company P receives new information indicating that the fair value of the contingent liabilities should be $600,000.

**Accounting Treatment:**

1. **Initial Recognition:**
   - Contingent liabilities are recorded at $500,000 at the acquisition date.

2. **Measurement Period Adjustment:**
   - The fair value of the contingent liabilities is adjusted to $600,000.
   - The adjustment is made retrospectively.

3. **Journal Entry:**
   - Debit: Goodwill $100,000
   - Credit: Contingent Liabilities $100,000

**Impact:**

The adjustment increases both the contingent liabilities and goodwill. This ensures that the financial statements reflect the accurate fair value of the contingent liabilities at the acquisition date.

### Practical Example 5: Acquisition of a Financial Services Firm

**Scenario:**

Company R acquires Company S, a financial services firm, on December 31, 2023. At the acquisition date, Company R estimates the fair value of Company S's customer relationships at $2 million. During the measurement period, Company R obtains new information indicating that the fair value of these customer relationships should be $2.5 million.

**Accounting Treatment:**

1. **Initial Recognition:**
   - Customer relationships are recorded at $2 million at the acquisition date.

2. **Measurement Period Adjustment:**
   - The fair value of the customer relationships is adjusted to $2.5 million.
   - The adjustment is made retrospectively.

3. **Journal Entry:**
   - Debit: Customer Relationships $500,000
   - Credit: Goodwill $500,000

**Impact:**

This adjustment increases the value of customer relationships and decreases goodwill. The retrospective adjustment ensures the financial statements accurately reflect the fair value of the customer relationships as of the acquisition date.

### Practical Example 6: Acquisition of an Energy Company

**Scenario:**

Company T acquires Company U, an energy company, on April 10, 2023. At the acquisition date, Company T estimates the fair value of Company U's environmental liabilities at $800,000. During the measurement period, Company T receives new information indicating that the fair value of the environmental liabilities should be $900,000.

**Accounting Treatment:**

1. **Initial Recognition:**
   - Environmental liabilities are recorded at $800,000 at the acquisition date.

2. **Measurement Period Adjustment:**
   - The fair value of the environmental liabilities is adjusted to $900,000.
   - The adjustment is made retrospectively.

3. **Journal Entry:**
   - Debit: Goodwill $100,000
   - Credit: Environmental Liabilities $100,000

**Impact:**

The adjustment increases both the environmental liabilities and goodwill. This ensures that the financial statements reflect the accurate fair value of the environmental liabilities at the acquisition date.

### Practical Example 7: Acquisition of a Telecommunications Company

Company V acquires Company W, a telecommunications company, on July 20, 2023. At the acquisition date, Company V estimates the fair value of Company W's network infrastructure at $10 million. During the measurement period, Company V obtains new information indicating that the fair value of the network infrastructure should be $11 million.

**Accounting Treatment:**

1. **Initial Recognition:**
