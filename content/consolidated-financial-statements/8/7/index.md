## 8.7 Recording Impairment Losses

### Introduction

Recording impairment losses is a critical aspect of financial reporting, particularly in the context of consolidated financial statements and business combinations. Impairment losses occur when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, necessitating a write-down to reflect the asset's diminished value. This section will guide you through the process of recognizing and measuring impairment losses, focusing on Canadian accounting standards, including International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).

### Understanding Impairment Losses

Impairment losses are recognized when an asset's carrying value is not recoverable. This typically occurs due to changes in market conditions, technological advancements, or other factors that reduce the asset's expected future cash flows. Recognizing impairment losses is essential for providing a true and fair view of a company's financial position.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Carrying Amount:** The amount at which an asset is recognized in the balance sheet after deducting accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
- **Recoverable Amount:** The higher of an asset's fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use.
- **Value in Use:** The present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or cash-generating unit (CGU).

### Impairment Testing Process

The impairment testing process involves several key steps:

1. **Identify Indicators of Impairment:** Regularly assess whether there are indicators that an asset may be impaired. Indicators can be external (e.g., market decline) or internal (e.g., obsolescence).

2. **Determine the Recoverable Amount:** Calculate the recoverable amount as the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use.

3. **Compare Carrying Amount and Recoverable Amount:** If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, an impairment loss must be recognized.

4. **Recognize the Impairment Loss:** Write down the asset to its recoverable amount and recognize the impairment loss in the income statement.

5. **Disclose Impairment Losses:** Provide detailed disclosures in the financial statements regarding the impairment loss recognized.

### Impairment of Goodwill

Goodwill, an intangible asset arising from business combinations, is particularly susceptible to impairment. Unlike other assets, goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist.

**Steps for Goodwill Impairment Testing:**

1. **Allocate Goodwill to CGUs:** Allocate goodwill to the cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination.

2. **Perform Impairment Test:** Compare the carrying amount of the CGU, including goodwill, with its recoverable amount.

3. **Recognize Impairment Loss:** If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, recognize an impairment loss. The loss is first allocated to goodwill and then to other assets of the CGU on a pro-rata basis.

### IFRS vs. GAAP: Key Differences

While both IFRS and GAAP require impairment testing, there are notable differences in their approaches:

- **Frequency of Testing:** IFRS requires annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, while GAAP mandates annual testing for goodwill but allows for qualitative assessments to determine if quantitative testing is necessary.

- **Reversal of Impairment Losses:** Under IFRS, impairment losses on assets other than goodwill can be reversed if the recoverable amount increases. GAAP prohibits the reversal of impairment losses.

### Practical Example: Goodwill Impairment

Consider a company, ABC Corp, which acquired a subsidiary, XYZ Ltd, resulting in goodwill of $500,000. During the annual impairment test, the recoverable amount of the CGU to which XYZ Ltd belongs is determined to be $1,200,000, while the carrying amount is $1,500,000.

**Calculation:**

- **Carrying Amount of CGU:** $1,500,000
- **Recoverable Amount of CGU:** $1,200,000
- **Impairment Loss:** $1,500,000 - $1,200,000 = $300,000

ABC Corp must recognize an impairment loss of $300,000, reducing the carrying amount of goodwill.

### Regulatory Considerations

In Canada, impairment testing and recording are governed by IFRS as adopted by the Canadian Accounting Standards Board (AcSB). It is crucial for accountants to stay updated with any changes in standards and ensure compliance with disclosure requirements.

### Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

**Common Pitfalls:**

- **Overlooking Indicators of Impairment:** Regularly assess both external and internal indicators to avoid missing potential impairments.
- **Incorrect Calculation of Recoverable Amount:** Ensure accurate estimation of future cash flows and appropriate discount rates.
- **Inadequate Disclosure:** Provide comprehensive disclosures to enhance transparency and comply with regulatory requirements.

**Best Practices:**

- **Regular Training and Updates:** Stay informed about changes in accounting standards and best practices.
- **Robust Internal Controls:** Implement strong internal controls to ensure accurate and timely impairment testing.
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Maintain detailed documentation of impairment testing processes and assumptions.

### Conclusion

Recording impairment losses is a vital aspect of financial reporting, ensuring that financial statements accurately reflect the economic realities of a business. By understanding the principles and processes involved in impairment testing, you can effectively navigate this complex area of accounting and enhance your preparation for Canadian accounting exams.

- [x] To ensure that the carrying amount of an asset does not exceed its recoverable amount
- [ ] To calculate depreciation
- [ ] To determine the fair value of an asset
- [ ] To allocate goodwill to cash-generating units

> **Explanation:** Impairment testing ensures that the carrying amount of an asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, reflecting its true economic value.

### Under IFRS, how often must goodwill be tested for impairment?

- [x] Annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist
- [ ] Every two years
- [ ] Only when there are indicators of impairment
- [ ] Quarterly
