## 15.8 Practical Examples of Deconsolidation

Deconsolidation is a critical aspect of accounting for business combinations, particularly when a parent company loses control over a subsidiary. This section provides practical examples and case studies to illustrate the deconsolidation process, focusing on Canadian accounting standards and practices. Understanding these examples will help you grasp the complexities of deconsolidation and prepare effectively for Canadian accounting exams.

### Understanding Deconsolidation

Deconsolidation occurs when a parent company loses control over a subsidiary, leading to the removal of the subsidiary's financial statements from the consolidated financial statements of the parent company. This process involves several steps, including the recognition of any gain or loss on deconsolidation, reclassification of other comprehensive income, and derecognition of assets and liabilities.

### Key Concepts in Deconsolidation

Before diving into practical examples, it's essential to understand the key concepts involved in deconsolidation:

- **Loss of Control:** This is the primary trigger for deconsolidation. Control is typically lost when the parent company sells or transfers its controlling interest in the subsidiary.
- **Derecognition of Assets and Liabilities:** Upon deconsolidation, the parent company must remove the subsidiary's assets and liabilities from its consolidated financial statements.
- **Gain or Loss on Deconsolidation:** The parent company must recognize any gain or loss resulting from the deconsolidation process.
- **Reclassification of Other Comprehensive Income (OCI):** Any amounts related to the subsidiary that were previously recognized in OCI must be reclassified to profit or loss.

### Practical Example 1: Sale of Controlling Interest

#### Scenario

Company A owns 80% of Company B, a subsidiary. Company A decides to sell 60% of its interest in Company B to an external party, resulting in a loss of control. The remaining 20% interest is retained as an investment.

#### Steps in Deconsolidation

1. **Derecognition of Subsidiary's Assets and Liabilities:**
   - Remove Company B's assets and liabilities from Company A's consolidated financial statements.

2. **Recognition of Gain or Loss:**
   - Calculate the gain or loss on deconsolidation by comparing the fair value of the consideration received with the carrying amount of the subsidiary's net assets and non-controlling interest.

3. **Reclassification of OCI:**
   - Reclassify any amounts related to Company B that were previously recognized in OCI to profit or loss.

4. **Recognition of Retained Interest:**
   - Recognize the retained 20% interest in Company B as a financial asset, measured at fair value.

#### Calculation Example

Assume the following:
- Fair value of consideration received: $500,000
- Carrying amount of Company B's net assets: $400,000
- Non-controlling interest: $80,000
- Fair value of retained interest: $100,000

**Gain on Deconsolidation:**
{{< katex >}} \text{Gain} = (\text{Fair value of consideration} + \text{Fair value of retained interest}) - (\text{Carrying amount of net assets} + \text{Non-controlling interest}) {{< /katex >}}

{{< katex >}} \text{Gain} = (500,000 + 100,000) - (400,000 + 80,000) = 120,000 {{< /katex >}}

### Practical Example 2: Loss of Control through Dilution

#### Scenario

Company C owns 70% of Company D. Company D issues new shares to a third party, diluting Company C's interest to 45%, resulting in a loss of control.

#### Steps in Deconsolidation

1. **Derecognition of Subsidiary's Assets and Liabilities:**
   - Remove Company D's assets and liabilities from Company C's consolidated financial statements.

2. **Recognition of Gain or Loss:**
   - Calculate the gain or loss on deconsolidation based on the change in ownership interest.

3. **Reclassification of OCI:**
   - Reclassify any amounts related to Company D that were previously recognized in OCI to profit or loss.

4. **Recognition of Retained Interest:**
   - Recognize the retained 45% interest in Company D as an associate, accounted for using the equity method.

#### Calculation Example

Assume the following:
- Fair value of Company D's net assets: $600,000
- Fair value of Company C's retained interest (45%): $270,000

**Gain on Deconsolidation:**
{{< katex >}} \text{Gain} = \text{Fair value of retained interest} - \text{Carrying amount of investment in subsidiary} {{< /katex >}}

Assuming the carrying amount of Company C's investment in Company D was $400,000:

{{< katex >}} \text{Gain} = 270,000 - 400,000 = -130,000 {{< /katex >}}

This results in a loss on deconsolidation.

### Practical Example 3: Spin-off of a Subsidiary

#### Scenario

Company E decides to spin off its wholly-owned subsidiary, Company F, by distributing Company F's shares to Company E's shareholders.

#### Steps in Deconsolidation

1. **Derecognition of Subsidiary's Assets and Liabilities:**
   - Remove Company F's assets and liabilities from Company E's consolidated financial statements.

2. **Recognition of Gain or Loss:**
   - Calculate the gain or loss on deconsolidation based on the fair value of Company F at the time of the spin-off.

3. **Reclassification of OCI:**
   - Reclassify any amounts related to Company F that were previously recognized in OCI to profit or loss.

4. **Distribution to Shareholders:**
   - Recognize the distribution of Company F's shares to Company E's shareholders as a reduction in equity.

#### Calculation Example

Assume the following:
- Fair value of Company F: $800,000
- Carrying amount of Company F's net assets: $750,000

**Gain on Deconsolidation:**
{{< katex >}} \text{Gain} = \text{Fair value of Company F} - \text{Carrying amount of net assets} {{< /katex >}}

{{< katex >}} \text{Gain} = 800,000 - 750,000 = 50,000 {{< /katex >}}

### Practical Example 4: Deconsolidation Due to Bankruptcy

#### Scenario

Company G's subsidiary, Company H, files for bankruptcy, resulting in a loss of control for Company G.

#### Steps in Deconsolidation

1. **Derecognition of Subsidiary's Assets and Liabilities:**
   - Remove Company H's assets and liabilities from Company G's consolidated financial statements.

2. **Recognition of Gain or Loss:**
   - Calculate the gain or loss on deconsolidation based on the fair value of Company H at the time of bankruptcy.

3. **Reclassification of OCI:**
   - Reclassify any amounts related to Company H that were previously recognized in OCI to profit or loss.

4. **Recognition of Any Remaining Interest:**
   - If Company G retains any interest in Company H, recognize it as a financial asset at fair value.

#### Calculation Example

Assume the following:
- Fair value of Company H at bankruptcy: $0
- Carrying amount of Company H's net assets: $500,000

**Loss on Deconsolidation:**
{{< katex >}} \text{Loss} = \text{Fair value of Company H} - \text{Carrying amount of net assets} {{< /katex >}}

{{< katex >}} \text{Loss} = 0 - 500,000 = -500,000 {{< /katex >}}

### Practical Example 5: Deconsolidation Due to Legal Reorganization

#### Scenario

Company I undergoes a legal reorganization, resulting in the transfer of its subsidiary, Company J, to a newly formed entity, resulting in a loss of control.

#### Steps in Deconsolidation

1. **Derecognition of Subsidiary's Assets and Liabilities:**
   - Remove Company J's assets and liabilities from Company I's consolidated financial statements.

2. **Recognition of Gain or Loss:**
   - Calculate the gain or loss on deconsolidation based on the fair value of Company J at the time of reorganization.

3. **Reclassification of OCI:**
   - Reclassify any amounts related to Company J that were previously recognized in OCI to profit or loss.

4. **Recognition of Any Remaining Interest:**
   - If Company I retains any interest in Company J, recognize it as a financial asset at fair value.

#### Calculation Example

Assume the following:
- Fair value of Company J after reorganization: $700,000
- Carrying amount of Company J's net assets: $650,000

**Gain on Deconsolidation:**
{{< katex >}} \text{Gain} = \text{Fair value of Company J} - \text{Carrying amount of net assets} {{< /katex >}}

{{< katex >}} \text{Gain} = 700,000 - 650,000 = 50,000 {{< /katex >}}

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

#### Best Practices

- **Accurate Valuation:** Ensure that the fair value of the subsidiary and any retained interest is accurately determined at the time of deconsolidation.
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Maintain detailed records of the deconsolidation process, including calculations and justifications for any gain or loss recognized.
