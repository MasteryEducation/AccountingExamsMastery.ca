## 16.7 Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements

Fair value measurements play a crucial role in financial reporting, especially in the context of business combinations. Understanding the required disclosures for fair value measurements is essential for preparing accurate and transparent consolidated financial statements. This section provides an in-depth exploration of the disclosure requirements, practical examples, and exam preparation strategies, focusing on Canadian accounting standards and practices.

### Understanding Fair Value Measurements

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. It is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement, and requires consideration of the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.

#### Key Concepts in Fair Value Measurements

1. **Market Participants:** These are buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability who are independent, knowledgeable, and willing to transact.

2. **Principal Market:** The market with the greatest volume and level of activity for the asset or liability.

3. **Most Advantageous Market:** The market that maximizes the amount that would be received to sell the asset or minimizes the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability, after considering transaction costs and transport costs.

4. **Valuation Techniques:** These include the market approach, income approach, and cost approach, each of which uses different methods to determine fair value.

5. **Fair Value Hierarchy:** This categorizes the inputs to valuation techniques into three levels:
   - **Level 1:** Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
   - **Level 2:** Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
   - **Level 3:** Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

### Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurements

The disclosure requirements for fair value measurements are designed to provide users of financial statements with information about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value. These disclosures are essential for understanding the judgments and estimates made by management in determining fair values.

#### IFRS 13: Fair Value Measurement

Under IFRS 13, entities are required to disclose information that helps users of financial statements assess the valuation techniques and inputs used to develop fair value measurements. The key disclosure requirements include:

1. **Fair Value Hierarchy:** Disclose the level of the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurements are categorized in their entirety.

2. **Valuation Techniques and Inputs:** Describe the valuation techniques and inputs used in the fair value measurement for each class of assets and liabilities.

3. **Reconciliation of Level 3 Measurements:** Provide a reconciliation of the opening and closing balances of recurring Level 3 fair value measurements, including total gains or losses, purchases, sales, issues, and settlements.

4. **Sensitivity Analysis:** For recurring Level 3 fair value measurements, disclose a narrative description of the sensitivity of the fair value measurement to changes in unobservable inputs.

5. **Non-Recurring Fair Value Measurements:** Disclose the reasons for the fair value measurement and the line item(s) in the statement of financial position in which the fair value measurement is included.

#### ASPE 3856: Financial Instruments

For private enterprises in Canada, ASPE 3856 outlines the requirements for fair value measurement disclosures. Key requirements include:

1. **Measurement Basis:** Disclose the measurement basis for each class of financial assets and financial liabilities.

2. **Fair Value Hierarchy:** Similar to IFRS, disclose the level within the fair value hierarchy for each class of financial assets and liabilities.

3. **Valuation Techniques:** Describe the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value.

4. **Changes in Fair Value:** Disclose the amount of any changes in fair value recognized in net income or other comprehensive income during the period.

### Practical Examples and Case Studies

To illustrate the application of fair value measurement disclosures, consider the following examples:

#### Example 1: Business Combination with Level 3 Fair Value Measurements

Company A acquires Company B in a business combination. As part of the acquisition, Company A recognizes an intangible asset with a fair value measured using Level 3 inputs. The valuation technique used is the income approach, with significant unobservable inputs including projected cash flows and discount rates.

**Disclosure:**
- **Fair Value Hierarchy:** The intangible asset is categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
- **Valuation Techniques and Inputs:** The income approach was used, with key inputs being projected cash flows and a discount rate of 10%.
- **Reconciliation of Level 3 Measurements:** A reconciliation of the opening and closing balances of the intangible asset, including any changes in fair value, is provided.
- **Sensitivity Analysis:** A narrative description of the sensitivity of the fair value measurement to changes in the discount rate is included.

#### Example 2: Non-Recurring Fair Value Measurement

Company C decides to sell a manufacturing plant, resulting in a non-recurring fair value measurement. The fair value is determined using the market approach, based on recent sales of similar properties.

**Disclosure:**
- **Non-Recurring Fair Value Measurement:** The manufacturing plant is measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis due to the decision to sell.
- **Valuation Techniques and Inputs:** The market approach was used, with inputs including recent sales of similar properties.
- **Line Item in Financial Statements:** The fair value measurement is included in the line item "Assets held for sale" in the statement of financial position.

### Exam Preparation Strategies

To effectively prepare for questions related to fair value measurement disclosures on the Canadian Accounting Exams, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand the Fair Value Hierarchy:** Familiarize yourself with the three levels of the fair value hierarchy and the types of inputs associated with each level.

2. **Practice Valuation Techniques:** Gain a solid understanding of the market, income, and cost approaches to valuation, and practice applying these techniques to different scenarios.

3. **Review Disclosure Requirements:** Study the specific disclosure requirements under IFRS 13 and ASPE 3856, and practice identifying the necessary disclosures for various fair value measurements.

4. **Analyze Case Studies:** Work through case studies and practical examples to apply your knowledge of fair value measurement disclosures in real-world scenarios.

5. **Focus on Level 3 Measurements:** Pay special attention to the disclosure requirements for Level 3 fair value measurements, including sensitivity analysis and reconciliation of balances.

6. **Utilize Practice Questions:** Test your understanding with practice questions and quizzes that mirror the format and difficulty level of the actual exam.

### Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

When preparing fair value measurement disclosures, be aware of common pitfalls and best practices:

#### Common Pitfalls

1. **Inadequate Disclosure of Valuation Techniques:** Failing to provide sufficient detail about the valuation techniques and inputs used can lead to incomplete disclosures.

2. **Omitting Sensitivity Analysis:** Neglecting to include a sensitivity analysis for Level 3 measurements can result in non-compliance with disclosure requirements.

3. **Misclassification in the Fair Value Hierarchy:** Incorrectly categorizing fair value measurements within the hierarchy can lead to inaccurate disclosures.

#### Best Practices

1. **Provide Detailed Descriptions:** Ensure that descriptions of valuation techniques and inputs are comprehensive and clear.

2. **Include Sensitivity Analysis:** Always include a narrative description of the sensitivity of Level 3 measurements to changes in unobservable inputs.

3. **Regularly Review and Update Disclosures:** Continuously review and update fair value measurement disclosures to reflect any changes in valuation techniques or inputs.

### Regulatory References and Additional Resources

For further exploration of fair value measurement disclosures, consider the following resources:

1. **IFRS 13: Fair Value Measurement:** Review the full text of IFRS 13 for detailed guidance on fair value measurement and disclosure requirements.

2. **ASPE 3856: Financial Instruments:** Study ASPE 3856 for the specific requirements applicable to private enterprises in Canada.
