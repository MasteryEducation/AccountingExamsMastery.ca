## 1.6 Key Terminology in Consolidation Accounting

Understanding the key terminology in consolidation accounting is crucial for anyone preparing for Canadian accounting exams. This section will provide a comprehensive overview of the essential terms and definitions used in consolidation, such as parent, subsidiary, non-controlling interest, and more. By familiarizing yourself with these terms, you'll be better equipped to tackle exam questions and apply these concepts in real-world scenarios.

### Parent Company

A **parent company** is an entity that holds a controlling interest in another company, known as a subsidiary. Control is typically established through ownership of more than 50% of the subsidiary's voting shares. The parent company consolidates the financial statements of its subsidiaries to present a single set of financial statements for the entire group. This consolidation reflects the financial position and performance of the parent and its subsidiaries as a single economic entity.

**Example:** If Company A owns 60% of Company B's voting shares, Company A is the parent company, and Company B is the subsidiary.

### Subsidiary

A **subsidiary** is a company that is controlled by a parent company. The control is usually achieved through the ownership of more than 50% of the subsidiary's voting shares. Subsidiaries are separate legal entities, but their financial statements are consolidated with those of the parent company to provide a comprehensive view of the financial performance and position of the entire group.

**Example:** Continuing from the previous example, Company B is the subsidiary of Company A.

### Non-Controlling Interest (NCI)

**Non-controlling interest (NCI)**, also known as minority interest, represents the portion of a subsidiary's equity that is not owned by the parent company. In consolidated financial statements, NCI is reported separately from the parent company's equity. This allows stakeholders to see the portion of net assets and net income attributable to the non-controlling shareholders.

**Example:** If Company A owns 60% of Company B, the remaining 40% is the non-controlling interest.

### Control

**Control** is a key concept in consolidation accounting, defined as the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity to obtain benefits from its activities. Control is typically achieved through ownership of more than 50% of the voting rights, but it can also be established through other means, such as contractual arrangements or the ability to appoint the majority of the board of directors.

### Consolidated Financial Statements

**Consolidated financial statements** are financial statements that present the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of a parent company and its subsidiaries as a single economic entity. These statements eliminate intercompany transactions and balances to provide a clear picture of the group's overall financial health.

### Acquisition Method

The **acquisition method** is the approach used to account for business combinations. It involves recognizing and measuring the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at their fair values on the acquisition date. The acquisition method also requires the recognition of goodwill or a gain from a bargain purchase.

### Goodwill

**Goodwill** is an intangible asset that arises when a parent company acquires a subsidiary for more than the fair value of its identifiable net assets. Goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from assets that are not individually identified and separately recognized. It is tested annually for impairment to ensure it is not overstated on the balance sheet.

### Fair Value

**Fair value** is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In consolidation accounting, fair value is used to measure the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.

### Intercompany Transactions

**Intercompany transactions** are transactions that occur between entities within the same group, such as sales of goods or services, loans, or dividends. These transactions must be eliminated in the consolidated financial statements to avoid double counting and to present the group as a single economic entity.

### Elimination Entries

**Elimination entries** are journal entries made during the consolidation process to remove the effects of intercompany transactions and balances. These entries ensure that the consolidated financial statements reflect only transactions with external parties.

### Equity Method

The **equity method** is an accounting technique used to record investments in associates or joint ventures where the investor has significant influence but not control. Under the equity method, the investor recognizes its share of the investee's profits or losses in its income statement and adjusts the carrying amount of the investment on the balance sheet.

### Joint Arrangements

**Joint arrangements** are contractual agreements where two or more parties have joint control over an economic activity. Joint arrangements can be classified as joint operations or joint ventures, depending on the rights and obligations of the parties involved.

### Variable Interest Entity (VIE)

A **variable interest entity (VIE)** is an entity in which the investor holds a controlling interest that is not based on the majority of voting rights. VIEs are consolidated by the primary beneficiary, who is the party that absorbs the majority of the entity's expected losses or receives the majority of its expected residual returns.

### Special Purpose Entity (SPE)

A **special purpose entity (SPE)** is a legal entity created for a specific, limited purpose, often to isolate financial risk. SPEs are commonly used in structured finance transactions. If a company has control over an SPE, it must consolidate the SPE's financial statements with its own.

### Push-Down Accounting

**Push-down accounting** is an accounting method where the acquirer's basis of accounting is pushed down to the acquired entity's financial statements. This approach is used to align the accounting records of the subsidiary with those of the parent company.

### Bargain Purchase

A **bargain purchase** occurs when the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination exceeds the consideration transferred. In such cases, the acquirer recognizes a gain in the income statement.

### Contingent Consideration

**Contingent consideration** is an obligation of the acquirer to transfer additional assets or equity interests to the former owners of an acquiree if specified future events occur or conditions are met. Contingent consideration is measured at fair value on the acquisition date and subsequently remeasured at each reporting date.

### Measurement Period

The **measurement period** is the period after the acquisition date during which the acquirer may adjust the provisional amounts recognized for a business combination. This period allows the acquirer to obtain additional information about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date.

### Step Acquisition

A **step acquisition** occurs when a company acquires control of a subsidiary in stages, rather than in a single transaction. Each step is accounted for separately, and the carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to reflect the fair value of the acquired interest at each stage.

### Deconsolidation

**Deconsolidation** is the process of removing a subsidiary's financial statements from the consolidated financial statements when the parent company loses control over the subsidiary. This can occur through the sale of shares, loss of voting rights, or other changes in circumstances.

### Retained Earnings

**Retained earnings** represent the cumulative net income of a company that has not been distributed to shareholders as dividends. In consolidation accounting, retained earnings are adjusted for the parent's share of the subsidiary's post-acquisition profits and losses.

### Comprehensive Income

**Comprehensive income** includes all changes in equity during a period, except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. It encompasses net income and other comprehensive income, such as foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities.

### Foreign Currency Translation

**Foreign currency translation** is the process of converting the financial statements of a foreign subsidiary into the parent company's functional currency. This involves translating the subsidiary's assets, liabilities, income, and expenses at appropriate exchange rates.

### Functional Currency

The **functional currency** is the currency of the primary economic environment in which an entity operates. It is the currency in which the entity primarily generates and expends cash. The functional currency is used to measure the entity's financial performance and position.

### Hedging

**Hedging** is a risk management strategy used to offset potential losses in one investment by making another investment. In consolidation accounting, hedging is often used to manage foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, or commodity price risk.

### Disclosure Requirements

**Disclosure requirements** refer to the specific information that must be provided in the financial statements to ensure transparency and provide stakeholders with a clear understanding of the company's financial position and performance. In consolidation accounting, disclosures may include information about the basis of consolidation, non-controlling interests, and significant accounting policies.

### Regulatory Framework

The **regulatory framework** for consolidation accounting includes the accounting standards and guidelines that govern the preparation and presentation of consolidated financial statements. In Canada, this framework includes the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the Canadian Accounting Standards Board (AcSB).

### IFRS 10

**IFRS 10: Consolidated Financial Statements** is the International Financial Reporting Standard that provides guidance on the preparation and presentation of consolidated financial statements. It defines the principles of control and sets out the requirements for consolidating subsidiaries.

### ASC Topic 810

**ASC Topic 810: Consolidation** is the section of the U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) that provides guidance on consolidation accounting. It includes the criteria for determining control and the requirements for consolidating variable interest entities.

### Recent Updates and Convergence Efforts

Recent updates and convergence efforts refer to the ongoing process of aligning IFRS and GAAP standards to reduce differences and improve comparability between financial statements prepared under different accounting frameworks. This includes updates to consolidation accounting standards and efforts to harmonize definitions and requirements.

### Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

Understanding common pitfalls and best practices in consolidation accounting can help you avoid errors and improve the quality of your financial statements. Common pitfalls include misidentifying the acquirer, failing to eliminate intercompany transactions, and incorrect measurement of non-controlling interests. Best practices include thorough documentation, regular review of consolidation procedures, and staying up-to-date with changes in accounting standards.
