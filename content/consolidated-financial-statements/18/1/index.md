## 18.1 Consolidation of a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary

Consolidating a wholly-owned subsidiary is a fundamental aspect of preparing consolidated financial statements. This process involves combining the financial statements of a parent company with its subsidiary to present them as a single entity. Understanding this process is crucial for Canadian accounting exams and for professionals involved in financial reporting. This guide provides a detailed walk-through of the consolidation process, highlighting key concepts, practical examples, and best practices.

### Understanding Consolidation

Consolidation is the process of combining the financial statements of a parent company and its subsidiaries, presenting them as a single entity. This is essential for providing a comprehensive view of the financial position and performance of the entire group. In a wholly-owned subsidiary scenario, the parent company owns 100% of the subsidiary, simplifying certain aspects of consolidation, such as the absence of non-controlling interests.

### Key Concepts in Consolidation

#### The Concept of Control

Control is a critical factor in determining whether consolidation is required. Under IFRS 10, control is defined as the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity to obtain benefits from its activities. In a wholly-owned subsidiary, the parent company has complete control, making consolidation mandatory.

#### Elimination of Intercompany Transactions

One of the primary tasks in consolidation is the elimination of intercompany transactions. These are transactions that occur between the parent and subsidiary, such as sales, loans, or dividends. Eliminating these transactions prevents double counting and ensures that the consolidated financial statements reflect only external transactions.

#### Goodwill and Impairment

When a parent company acquires a subsidiary, it may pay more than the fair value of the identifiable net assets. This excess is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill must be tested for impairment annually, ensuring that it is not overstated on the balance sheet.

### Steps in Consolidating a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary

The consolidation process involves several key steps, each of which must be executed carefully to ensure accuracy and compliance with accounting standards.

#### Step 1: Prepare the Individual Financial Statements

Before consolidation, ensure that both the parent and subsidiary have prepared their individual financial statements according to the relevant accounting standards. This includes the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement.

#### Step 2: Align Accounting Policies

Ensure that the accounting policies of the parent and subsidiary are aligned. This may involve adjusting the subsidiary's financial statements to conform to the parent's accounting policies.

#### Step 3: Eliminate Intercompany Transactions

Identify and eliminate all intercompany transactions. This includes:

- **Intercompany Sales:** Remove sales and corresponding cost of goods sold between the parent and subsidiary.
- **Intercompany Loans:** Eliminate any loans or advances between the entities, including interest income and expense.
- **Intercompany Dividends:** Remove dividends paid by the subsidiary to the parent.

#### Step 4: Adjust for Goodwill

Calculate and record goodwill, if applicable. Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the subsidiary. Ensure that goodwill is tested for impairment annually.

#### Step 5: Combine Financial Statements

Combine the adjusted financial statements of the parent and subsidiary. This involves summing the line items of the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement.

#### Step 6: Prepare Consolidated Financial Statements

Prepare the consolidated financial statements, ensuring that they present a true and fair view of the financial position and performance of the group. This includes the consolidated balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement.

### Practical Example: Consolidation of a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary

Let's consider a practical example to illustrate the consolidation process. Assume Company A is the parent company, and Company B is its wholly-owned subsidiary.

#### Initial Data

- **Company A (Parent):** Total assets of $1,000,000, total liabilities of $500,000, and equity of $500,000.
- **Company B (Subsidiary):** Total assets of $300,000, total liabilities of $150,000, and equity of $150,000.

#### Step-by-Step Consolidation

1. **Prepare Individual Financial Statements:**
   - Company A and Company B prepare their financial statements.

2. **Align Accounting Policies:**
   - Ensure both companies use consistent accounting policies.

3. **Eliminate Intercompany Transactions:**
   - Assume Company A sold goods worth $50,000 to Company B. Eliminate this sale and the corresponding cost of goods sold.

4. **Adjust for Goodwill:**
   - Assume Company A acquired Company B for $200,000. The fair value of Company B's net assets is $150,000. Record goodwill of $50,000.

5. **Combine Financial Statements:**
   - Combine the adjusted financial statements of Company A and Company B.

6. **Prepare Consolidated Financial Statements:**
   - Present the consolidated balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement.

### Common Challenges and Best Practices

#### Challenges

- **Complex Intercompany Transactions:** Identifying and eliminating complex intercompany transactions can be challenging.
- **Goodwill Impairment Testing:** Ensuring accurate and timely impairment testing of goodwill is critical.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Staying updated with changes in accounting standards and regulations is essential.

#### Best Practices

- **Regular Training and Updates:** Ensure that accounting staff are regularly trained and updated on changes in accounting standards.
- **Detailed Documentation:** Maintain detailed documentation of the consolidation process, including all adjustments and eliminations.
- **Use of Technology:** Leverage accounting software to streamline the consolidation process and ensure accuracy.

### Regulatory Considerations

In Canada, the consolidation of financial statements must comply with IFRS as adopted by the Canadian Accounting Standards Board (AcSB). Key standards include IFRS 10, IFRS 3 (Business Combinations), and IAS 36 (Impairment of Assets).

### Conclusion

Consolidating a wholly-owned subsidiary is a critical process that requires careful attention to detail and a thorough understanding of accounting standards. By following the steps outlined in this guide and adhering to best practices, you can ensure accurate and compliant consolidated financial statements. This knowledge is not only essential for Canadian accounting exams but also for professional practice in financial reporting.
