## 7.4 Consolidation of Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries

Consolidating wholly-owned subsidiaries is a critical aspect of preparing consolidated financial statements, particularly for those studying for Canadian accounting exams. This section provides an in-depth exploration of the consolidation process when a parent company owns 100% of a subsidiary. We will cover key accounting principles, procedures, and practical examples to enhance your understanding and prepare you for the exam.

### Understanding Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries

A wholly-owned subsidiary is a company whose entire share capital is held by another company, known as the parent company. This complete ownership gives the parent company full control over the subsidiary's operations and financial policies. In accounting terms, this control necessitates the preparation of consolidated financial statements, which present the financial position and results of operations for the parent and its subsidiaries as a single economic entity.

### Key Concepts and Terminology

- **Control:** The power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity to obtain benefits from its activities.
- **Consolidation:** The process of combining the financial statements of the parent company and its subsidiaries into one set of financial statements.
- **Elimination Entries:** Adjustments made to remove intercompany transactions and balances to avoid double counting.
- **Goodwill:** An intangible asset that arises when a parent company acquires a subsidiary for more than the fair value of its net identifiable assets.

### Regulatory Framework

In Canada, the consolidation of wholly-owned subsidiaries is governed by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), specifically IFRS 10: Consolidated Financial Statements. This standard outlines the principles for presenting and preparing consolidated financial statements when an entity controls one or more other entities.

### Steps in the Consolidation Process

The consolidation of wholly-owned subsidiaries involves several key steps:

1. **Identify the Parent and Subsidiary Relationship:** Confirm that the parent company has full control over the subsidiary, typically through 100% ownership of voting shares.

2. **Prepare the Financial Statements:** Gather the financial statements of both the parent and the subsidiary. These statements should be prepared using consistent accounting policies and for the same reporting period.

3. **Eliminate Intercompany Transactions and Balances:** Remove any transactions and balances between the parent and subsidiary to prevent double counting. This includes intercompany sales, loans, and dividends.

4. **Adjust for Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities:** Recognize any adjustments needed to align the subsidiary's assets and liabilities with their fair values at the acquisition date.

5. **Calculate and Record Goodwill:** If the acquisition cost exceeds the fair value of the net identifiable assets, record the excess as goodwill.

6. **Combine Financial Statements:** Add together the adjusted financial statements of the parent and subsidiary, ensuring that all intercompany transactions have been eliminated.

7. **Prepare Consolidated Financial Statements:** Present the combined financial information as a single set of financial statements, including the consolidated balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement.

### Practical Example

Consider a scenario where Company A (the parent) acquires 100% of Company B (the subsidiary). The following steps illustrate the consolidation process:

1. **Financial Statement Preparation:** Company A and Company B prepare their financial statements for the same reporting period using consistent accounting policies.

2. **Intercompany Transactions:** Assume Company A sold inventory to Company B for $100,000. This transaction must be eliminated from the consolidated financial statements.

3. **Fair Value Adjustments:** Company B's property is valued at $500,000, but its book value is $450,000. An adjustment is made to reflect the fair value.

4. **Goodwill Calculation:** If Company A paid $1,200,000 for Company B, and the fair value of Company B's net assets is $1,000,000, goodwill of $200,000 is recorded.

5. **Consolidation Entries:**

   - Eliminate the $100,000 intercompany sale.
   - Adjust the property value by $50,000.
   - Record $200,000 of goodwill.

6. **Consolidated Financial Statements:** The adjusted financial statements of Company A and Company B are combined to form the consolidated financial statements.

### Challenges and Best Practices

Consolidating wholly-owned subsidiaries can present several challenges, including:

- **Complex Intercompany Transactions:** Ensure all intercompany transactions are identified and eliminated.
- **Consistent Accounting Policies:** Align accounting policies across the parent and subsidiary to ensure consistency.
- **Accurate Fair Value Adjustments:** Properly assess and adjust the fair value of the subsidiary's assets and liabilities.

To overcome these challenges, consider the following best practices:

- **Thorough Documentation:** Maintain detailed records of all intercompany transactions and adjustments.
- **Regular Reviews:** Conduct periodic reviews of accounting policies and procedures to ensure alignment.
- **Professional Judgment:** Apply professional judgment when assessing the fair value of assets and liabilities.

### Regulatory Considerations

When consolidating wholly-owned subsidiaries, it is essential to comply with relevant accounting standards and regulations. In Canada, this includes adherence to IFRS 10 and other applicable standards. Additionally, consider any specific requirements set forth by CPA Canada and other regulatory bodies.

### Exam Preparation Tips

- **Understand Key Concepts:** Focus on understanding the principles of control, consolidation, and elimination entries.
- **Practice with Examples:** Work through practical examples and case studies to reinforce your understanding.
- **Review Accounting Standards:** Familiarize yourself with IFRS 10 and other relevant standards to ensure compliance.

### Conclusion

Consolidating wholly-owned subsidiaries is a fundamental aspect of preparing consolidated financial statements. By understanding the key concepts, regulatory framework, and best practices, you can effectively navigate the consolidation process and excel in your Canadian accounting exams.
