## 14.2 Criteria for Applying the Equity Method

The equity method of accounting is a crucial concept in financial reporting, especially when dealing with investments in associates. This method provides a framework for recognizing the investor's share of the investee's net assets and results of operations. Understanding when and how to apply the equity method is essential for accurate financial reporting and compliance with accounting standards, particularly in the context of Canadian accounting practices.

### Understanding the Equity Method

The equity method is used to account for investments in entities over which the investor has significant influence but not full control. Significant influence is typically presumed when the investor holds 20% to 50% of the voting power of the investee, but other factors can also indicate significant influence.

### Key Criteria for Applying the Equity Method

#### 1. **Significant Influence**

Significant influence is the cornerstone criterion for applying the equity method. It refers to the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, without having control or joint control over those policies. Indicators of significant influence include:

- **Representation on the board of directors** or equivalent governing body.
- **Participation in policy-making processes**, including decisions about dividends or other distributions.
- **Material transactions** between the investor and the investee.
- **Interchange of managerial personnel**.
- **Provision of essential technical information**.

It's important to note that the mere ownership of 20% or more of the voting power does not automatically confer significant influence. The investor must assess all relevant facts and circumstances.

#### 2. **Ownership Interest**

While the 20%-50% ownership threshold is a general guideline for significant influence, the actual percentage of ownership is not the sole determinant. The investor must evaluate the qualitative aspects of its relationship with the investee. For instance, if another investor holds a majority interest, the ability to exert significant influence may be diminished.

#### 3. **Joint Ventures and Associates**

The equity method is also applicable to joint ventures and associates. A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby two or more parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control. An associate, on the other hand, is an entity over which the investor has significant influence but not control or joint control.

#### 4. **Absence of Control**

The equity method is not applicable if the investor has control over the investee, as defined under IFRS 10 or ASC Topic 810. In such cases, the investor must consolidate the investee's financial statements.

### Accounting Standards and Guidelines

#### **IFRS and ASPE**

In Canada, the application of the equity method is governed by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Accounting Standards for Private Enterprises (ASPE). Under IFRS, IAS 28 "Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures" provides guidance on the equity method. ASPE Section 3051 "Investments" outlines similar principles for private enterprises.

#### **GAAP Considerations**

Under U.S. GAAP, the equity method is addressed in ASC Topic 323 "Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures". While there are similarities between IFRS and GAAP, there are also notable differences, particularly in the recognition and measurement of equity method investments.

### Practical Application and Examples

#### **Example 1: Investment in an Associate**

Consider a scenario where Company A acquires a 30% stake in Company B. Company A has representation on Company B's board and participates in its policy-making processes. Based on these facts, Company A determines that it has significant influence over Company B and applies the equity method to account for its investment.

#### **Example 2: Joint Venture Arrangement**

Company C enters into a joint venture with Company D, each holding a 50% interest. The joint venture agreement specifies that decisions require unanimous consent. As a result, Company C applies the equity method to account for its interest in the joint venture.

### Step-by-Step Guidance for Applying the Equity Method

1. **Initial Recognition**

   - Record the investment at cost, which includes the purchase price and any directly attributable transaction costs.

2. **Subsequent Measurement**

   - Adjust the carrying amount of the investment to recognize the investor's share of the investee's profits or losses.
   - Reduce the carrying amount for any dividends received from the investee.

3. **Impairment Considerations**

   - Assess the investment for impairment when there are indicators of a decline in value. If impaired, write down the investment to its recoverable amount.

4. **Disclosures**

   - Provide detailed disclosures about the nature of the investment, the investor's share of profits or losses, and any impairment losses recognized.

### Challenges and Best Practices

#### **Common Pitfalls**

- **Overlooking Significant Influence**: Failing to recognize significant influence can lead to incorrect application of accounting methods.
- **Inadequate Disclosures**: Insufficient disclosures can result in non-compliance with accounting standards and regulatory requirements.

#### **Best Practices**

- **Regular Assessment**: Continuously assess the level of influence over the investee, especially when ownership interests change.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Maintain thorough documentation of all factors considered in determining significant influence.

### Regulatory and Compliance Considerations

#### **CPA Canada Guidelines**

CPA Canada provides additional resources and guidance on the application of the equity method, emphasizing the importance of professional judgment and adherence to ethical standards.

#### **International Comparisons**

While the equity method is universally recognized, there are variations in its application across different jurisdictions. Understanding these differences is essential for multinational corporations and cross-border investments.

### Conclusion

The equity method of accounting is a vital tool for accurately reflecting the economic realities of investments in associates and joint ventures. By understanding the criteria for applying the equity method and adhering to relevant accounting standards, you can ensure transparent and reliable financial reporting.
