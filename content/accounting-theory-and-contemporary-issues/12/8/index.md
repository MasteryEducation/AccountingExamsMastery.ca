## 12.8 Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits

In the realm of accounting and financial reporting, assurance engagements play a crucial role in enhancing the credibility of financial information. While audits are the most recognized form of assurance engagements, there are other significant types that are essential for both practitioners and exam candidates to understand. This section delves into assurance engagements other than audits, focusing on reviews, compilations, and agreed-upon procedures. These engagements are vital for providing varying levels of assurance and are tailored to meet specific client needs.

### Understanding Assurance Engagements

Assurance engagements are processes where a practitioner evaluates or measures a subject matter against criteria to provide a conclusion that enhances the confidence of intended users. The primary objective is to provide assurance on the reliability and relevance of the information presented. The International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) provides guidelines for these engagements, ensuring consistency and quality in practice.

### Types of Assurance Engagements

1. **Reasonable Assurance Engagements**: These provide a high level of assurance, typically associated with audits.
2. **Limited Assurance Engagements**: These provide a moderate level of assurance, often associated with reviews.
3. **No Assurance Engagements**: These include compilations where no assurance is provided on the financial statements.

### Reviews

#### Definition and Purpose

A review engagement is designed to provide a moderate level of assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement. Unlike audits, reviews do not involve detailed testing of transactions and balances. Instead, they rely on analytical procedures and inquiries to assess the financial information.

#### Key Features of Review Engagements

- **Scope**: Less extensive than an audit, focusing on analytical procedures and inquiries.
- **Assurance Level**: Provides limited assurance, expressed in a negative form (e.g., "nothing has come to our attention").
- **Standards**: Governed by the Canadian Standard on Review Engagements (CSRE) 2400.
- **Reporting**: The report includes a conclusion on whether anything has come to the practitioner's attention that causes them to believe the financial statements are not prepared in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework.

#### Procedures in Review Engagements

- **Analytical Procedures**: Comparing financial data with prior periods, budgets, or industry norms.
- **Inquiries**: Engaging with management to understand the financial statements and the processes behind them.
- **Documentation**: Ensuring sufficient documentation to support the review conclusions.

#### Practical Example

Consider a small business that seeks a review engagement to satisfy a lender's requirement. The practitioner would perform analytical procedures on the financial statements, inquire about significant fluctuations, and issue a review report providing limited assurance.

### Compilations

#### Definition and Purpose

A compilation engagement involves assisting management in presenting financial information in the form of financial statements without providing any assurance. The practitioner compiles the financial data provided by the client into a set of financial statements.

#### Key Features of Compilation Engagements

- **Scope**: Involves assembling financial data without performing any verification or analysis.
- **Assurance Level**: No assurance is provided.
- **Standards**: Governed by the Canadian Standard on Related Services (CSRS) 4200.
- **Reporting**: The report states that no assurance is provided and that the financial statements may not be suitable for all users.

#### Procedures in Compilation Engagements

- **Data Collection**: Gathering financial data from the client.
- **Presentation**: Organizing the data into financial statements.
- **Disclosure**: Ensuring that the report clearly states the lack of assurance.

#### Practical Example

A startup company may require a compilation engagement to prepare financial statements for internal use or to present to potential investors. The practitioner compiles the data without verifying its accuracy, and the report clearly states no assurance is provided.

### Agreed-Upon Procedures

#### Definition and Purpose

Agreed-upon procedures engagements involve performing specific procedures on subject matter and reporting the findings without providing an opinion or conclusion. The procedures are agreed upon by the practitioner, the client, and any relevant third parties.

#### Key Features of Agreed-Upon Procedures

- **Scope**: Defined by the specific procedures agreed upon by the parties involved.
- **Assurance Level**: No assurance is provided; instead, factual findings are reported.
- **Standards**: Governed by the Canadian Standard on Related Services (CSRS) 4400.
- **Reporting**: The report details the procedures performed and the findings, without drawing conclusions.

#### Procedures in Agreed-Upon Procedures Engagements

- **Procedure Selection**: Determining the procedures to be performed based on the agreement.
- **Execution**: Performing the agreed-upon procedures.
- **Reporting**: Documenting the procedures and findings in a factual manner.

#### Practical Example

A company may engage a practitioner to perform agreed-upon procedures on its accounts receivable to verify specific balances for a potential acquirer. The practitioner performs the procedures and reports the findings without providing an opinion.

### Comparison of Assurance Engagements

The following table summarizes the key differences between audits, reviews, compilations, and agreed-upon procedures:

| Engagement Type         | Assurance Level | Scope and Procedures                         | Reporting Outcome                      |
|-------------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Audit                   | High            | Extensive testing and verification          | Opinion on financial statements        |
| Review                  | Moderate        | Analytical procedures and inquiries         | Negative assurance conclusion          |
| Compilation             | None            | Data assembly without verification          | No assurance, disclaimer of suitability|
| Agreed-Upon Procedures  | None            | Specific procedures as agreed               | Factual findings, no opinion           |

### Regulatory and Professional Considerations

#### Canadian Standards

- **CSRE 2400**: Governs review engagements, emphasizing limited assurance through analytical procedures and inquiries.
- **CSRS 4200**: Pertains to compilation engagements, focusing on data presentation without assurance.
- **CSRS 4400**: Relates to agreed-upon procedures, highlighting the performance of specific tasks without providing assurance.

#### Professional Judgment and Ethics

Practitioners must exercise professional judgment and adhere to ethical standards in all assurance engagements. This includes maintaining independence, objectivity, and confidentiality, as outlined by CPA Canada and other relevant bodies.

### Real-World Applications and Challenges

#### Case Studies

1. **Review Engagement for a Non-Profit**: A non-profit organization requires a review engagement to provide limited assurance to donors. The practitioner performs analytical procedures on donation revenue and expense allocations, issuing a report that enhances donor confidence.

2. **Compilation for a Small Business**: A small business owner needs financial statements for a loan application. The practitioner compiles the financial data into statements, ensuring the report clearly states no assurance is provided.

3. **Agreed-Upon Procedures for a Merger**: Two companies considering a merger engage a practitioner to perform agreed-upon procedures on specific financial metrics. The practitioner reports the findings, aiding the decision-making process without providing an opinion.

#### Challenges and Solutions

- **Client Expectations**: Clearly communicate the scope and limitations of each engagement type to manage client expectations effectively.
- **Documentation**: Ensure thorough documentation to support the procedures performed and the conclusions reached.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Stay updated with changes in standards and regulations to ensure compliance and maintain quality.

### Exam Preparation Tips

- **Understand Key Differences**: Focus on the differences in scope, assurance level, and reporting for each engagement type.
- **Practice Scenarios**: Work through practical examples and case studies to reinforce understanding.
- **Review Standards**: Familiarize yourself with relevant Canadian standards and their applications.
- **Ethical Considerations**: Emphasize the importance of ethics and professional judgment in all engagements.
