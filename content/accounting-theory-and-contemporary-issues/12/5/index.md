## 12.5 Audit Evidence and Testing

Audit evidence and testing form the backbone of the audit process, ensuring that financial statements are free from material misstatement and providing assurance to stakeholders. This section will delve into the methods of collecting and evaluating audit evidence, offering practical examples and insights relevant to Canadian accounting exams and professional practice.

### Understanding Audit Evidence

Audit evidence refers to the information collected by auditors to draw conclusions on which the audit opinion is based. It is crucial for auditors to gather sufficient and appropriate evidence to support their conclusions about the financial statements.

#### Characteristics of Audit Evidence

1. **Sufficiency and Appropriateness**: 
   - **Sufficiency** refers to the quantity of evidence needed. It is influenced by the auditor's assessment of risk and the quality of the evidence.
   - **Appropriateness** relates to the relevance and reliability of the evidence. Reliable evidence is obtained from independent sources outside the entity, generated internally under effective controls, or documented in a manner that can be verified.

2. **Relevance**: Evidence must be directly related to the assertion being tested.

3. **Reliability**: Factors affecting reliability include the source of the evidence, the nature of the evidence, and the circumstances under which it is obtained.

#### Types of Audit Evidence

- **Physical Evidence**: Tangible assets inspection, such as inventory counts.
- **Documentary Evidence**: Invoices, contracts, and other documentation.
- **Analytical Evidence**: Comparisons and analyses of financial and non-financial data.
- **Oral Evidence**: Statements or confirmations from management or third parties.
- **Electronic Evidence**: Data from IT systems and electronic records.

### Methods of Collecting Audit Evidence

Auditors employ various methods to gather evidence, each suited to different types of assertions and risks.

#### Inspection

Inspection involves examining records or tangible assets. This method is highly reliable when verifying the existence of assets or the accuracy of records.

- **Example**: Inspecting inventory to confirm existence and condition.

#### Observation

Observation entails watching a process or procedure being performed by others. While useful, it is limited to the point in time when the observation occurs.

- **Example**: Observing the counting of cash or inventory.

#### Inquiry

Inquiry involves seeking information from knowledgeable persons within or outside the entity. It is often used in conjunction with other methods to corroborate evidence.

- **Example**: Inquiring about the reasons for significant variances in financial data.

#### Confirmation

Confirmation is the process of obtaining a representation of information or conditions directly from a third party. It is particularly useful for verifying account balances and transactions.

- **Example**: Confirming accounts receivable balances with customers.

#### Recalculation

Recalculation involves checking the mathematical accuracy of documents or records. It is a straightforward method that provides reliable evidence.

- **Example**: Recalculating depreciation expense.

#### Reperformance

Reperformance is the auditor's independent execution of procedures or controls that were originally performed as part of the entity's internal control.

- **Example**: Reperforming a bank reconciliation.

#### Analytical Procedures

Analytical procedures involve evaluating financial information through analysis of plausible relationships among both financial and non-financial data. They are used in planning, substantive testing, and overall review stages.

- **Example**: Comparing current year revenue to prior years and industry averages.

### Evaluating Audit Evidence

Once evidence is collected, auditors must evaluate its sufficiency and appropriateness to form a basis for their opinion.

#### Factors Affecting Evaluation

1. **Risk Assessment**: Higher risk areas require more persuasive evidence.
2. **Materiality**: Evidence must be sufficient to address material misstatements.
3. **Professional Judgment**: Auditors use their expertise to assess the quality of evidence.

#### Documentation

Auditors must document the evidence gathered and the evaluation process to support their conclusions. This documentation is crucial for audit quality and compliance with standards.

### Practical Examples and Case Studies

#### Case Study: Inventory Valuation

An auditor is tasked with verifying the inventory valuation of a manufacturing company. The auditor uses a combination of inspection, observation, and recalculation to gather evidence.

- **Inspection**: Physically counts inventory items and compares them to records.
- **Observation**: Observes the client's year-end inventory count procedures.
- **Recalculation**: Verifies the cost calculations for inventory items.

#### Example: Accounts Receivable Confirmation

To verify accounts receivable, the auditor sends confirmation requests to a sample of customers. The responses are compared to the client's records to ensure accuracy.

### Real-World Applications and Regulatory Scenarios

In Canada, auditors must adhere to standards set by CPA Canada and other regulatory bodies. Understanding these standards is crucial for compliance and effective auditing.

#### Canadian Auditing Standards (CAS)

- **CAS 500**: Provides guidance on audit evidence.
- **CAS 505**: Addresses external confirmations.
- **CAS 520**: Covers analytical procedures.

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

#### Best Practices

- **Plan Thoroughly**: Develop a detailed audit plan that identifies key areas of risk and appropriate evidence-gathering techniques.
- **Use a Mix of Methods**: Combine different methods to gather comprehensive evidence.
- **Maintain Professional Skepticism**: Always question the reliability of evidence, especially when obtained from internal sources.

#### Common Pitfalls

- **Overreliance on Inquiry**: Inquiry alone is often insufficient and should be corroborated with other evidence.
- **Ignoring Contradictory Evidence**: Always investigate and resolve discrepancies in evidence.
- **Inadequate Documentation**: Ensure all evidence and evaluations are thoroughly documented.

### Strategies for Exam Preparation

- **Understand Key Concepts**: Focus on the characteristics and types of audit evidence.
- **Practice with Scenarios**: Work through case studies and examples to apply concepts.
- **Review Standards**: Familiarize yourself with relevant Canadian auditing standards.

### Summary

Audit evidence and testing are critical components of the audit process, providing the foundation for forming an audit opinion. By understanding the methods of collecting and evaluating evidence, auditors can ensure the reliability and accuracy of financial statements. This knowledge is essential for success in Canadian accounting exams and professional practice.
