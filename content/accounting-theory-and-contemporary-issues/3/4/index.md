## 3.4 Standard-Setting Bodies: IASB and FASB

In the realm of accounting, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) stand as pivotal institutions in the development and promulgation of accounting standards. Their influence extends globally, shaping the principles and practices that govern financial reporting. Understanding the roles, functions, and processes of these bodies is crucial for accounting professionals, particularly those preparing for Canadian accounting exams.

### Introduction to Standard-Setting Bodies

Standard-setting bodies are essential in establishing the guidelines and frameworks that ensure consistency, transparency, and comparability in financial reporting. The IASB and FASB are two of the most prominent organizations in this domain, each with its unique mandate and scope.

#### International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)

The IASB is an independent, private-sector body responsible for developing and issuing International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Established in 2001, the IASB succeeded the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) and is headquartered in London, United Kingdom. The IASB's primary objective is to create a single set of high-quality, understandable, and enforceable global accounting standards that bring transparency, accountability, and efficiency to financial markets worldwide.

#### Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)

The FASB, on the other hand, is the designated organization in the United States responsible for establishing standards of financial accounting and reporting. Founded in 1973, the FASB operates under the oversight of the Financial Accounting Foundation (FAF) and is based in Norwalk, Connecticut. The FASB's mission is to improve financial accounting and reporting standards to provide useful information to investors and other users of financial reports.

### Functions and Processes of the IASB

The IASB's role in the global accounting landscape is characterized by its rigorous standard-setting process, which involves multiple stages of consultation and collaboration with stakeholders.

#### Development of IFRS

The IASB follows a comprehensive due process in developing IFRS, which includes the following stages:

1. **Research and Consultation:** The IASB identifies and researches financial reporting issues, often in collaboration with national standard-setters. This stage involves extensive consultation with stakeholders, including preparers, auditors, regulators, and users of financial statements.

2. **Discussion Paper:** A discussion paper is published to solicit feedback on specific accounting issues. This document outlines the IASB's preliminary views and invites comments from interested parties.

3. **Exposure Draft:** Based on the feedback received, the IASB issues an exposure draft, which is a formal proposal for a new standard or an amendment to an existing one. The exposure draft is subject to public comment, allowing stakeholders to provide input on the proposed changes.

4. **Review and Finalization:** After considering the feedback on the exposure draft, the IASB reviews and finalizes the standard. This stage may involve further consultation and deliberation to address any remaining concerns.

5. **Publication of Standard:** The final standard is published, along with a basis for conclusions document that explains the IASB's reasoning and considerations in developing the standard.

6. **Post-Implementation Review:** After a standard has been implemented, the IASB conducts a post-implementation review to assess its effectiveness and address any issues that may have arisen.

#### Governance and Structure

The IASB operates under the oversight of the IFRS Foundation, which ensures the independence and accountability of the standard-setting process. The IFRS Foundation Trustees are responsible for appointing IASB members, overseeing the IASB's work, and securing funding for its activities.

The IASB comprises 14 members with diverse professional backgrounds, including accounting, finance, and academia. This diversity ensures a broad range of perspectives in the standard-setting process.

### Functions and Processes of the FASB

The FASB's approach to standard-setting is similarly structured, with a focus on transparency and stakeholder engagement.

#### Development of GAAP

The FASB's process for developing Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) involves several key steps:

1. **Agenda Setting:** The FASB identifies potential topics for standard-setting based on input from stakeholders, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), investors, and other financial statement users.

2. **Research and Analysis:** The FASB conducts research and analysis to understand the issues and potential solutions. This stage may involve forming task forces or working groups to provide expertise and insights.

3. **Preliminary Views:** The FASB may issue a document outlining its preliminary views on a particular issue, inviting feedback from stakeholders.

4. **Exposure Draft:** Similar to the IASB, the FASB issues an exposure draft to propose changes to GAAP. The exposure draft is open for public comment, allowing stakeholders to express their views.

5. **Deliberation and Finalization:** The FASB deliberates on the feedback received and makes necessary revisions to the proposed standard. The final standard is then issued, accompanied by a basis for conclusions document.

6. **Implementation and Review:** The FASB monitors the implementation of new standards and conducts post-implementation reviews to evaluate their effectiveness.

#### Governance and Structure

The FASB operates under the oversight of the Financial Accounting Foundation (FAF), which appoints FASB members and ensures the integrity of the standard-setting process. The FASB consists of seven full-time members with diverse expertise in accounting, finance, and business.

### Comparison of IASB and FASB

While both the IASB and FASB aim to improve financial reporting, there are notable differences in their approaches and the standards they develop.

#### Scope and Influence

- **IASB:** The IASB's standards, IFRS, are used by companies in over 140 countries, including Canada, where IFRS is mandatory for publicly accountable enterprises. The IASB's global reach makes it a key player in international financial reporting.

- **FASB:** The FASB's standards, GAAP, are primarily used in the United States. However, due to the size and influence of the U.S. economy, GAAP has a significant impact on global financial markets.

#### Convergence Efforts

The IASB and FASB have engaged in convergence efforts to harmonize IFRS and GAAP. These efforts aim to reduce differences between the two sets of standards, enhancing comparability for multinational corporations. Notable convergence projects include revenue recognition, leases, and financial instruments.

#### Differences in Standards

Despite convergence efforts, differences remain between IFRS and GAAP. For example, IFRS is generally considered more principles-based, allowing for greater interpretation and judgment, while GAAP is more rules-based, providing detailed guidance on specific issues.

### Practical Examples and Case Studies

To illustrate the impact of the IASB and FASB, consider the following examples:

- **Revenue Recognition:** The joint project on revenue recognition led to the issuance of IFRS 15 and ASC 606, which provide a unified framework for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers. This convergence project has improved consistency in revenue reporting across industries and jurisdictions.

- **Leases:** The IASB's IFRS 16 and the FASB's ASC 842 introduced significant changes to lease accounting, requiring lessees to recognize most leases on the balance sheet. This change enhances transparency and comparability in financial statements.

### Real-World Applications and Regulatory Scenarios

Understanding the roles of the IASB and FASB is essential for accounting professionals navigating the complexities of global financial reporting. In Canada, where IFRS is the standard for publicly accountable enterprises, familiarity with IASB standards is crucial. However, Canadian accountants must also be aware of GAAP, particularly when dealing with U.S.-based clients or subsidiaries.

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

When preparing for Canadian accounting exams, consider the following best practices:

- **Stay Informed:** Keep up-to-date with developments in IFRS and GAAP, including new standards and amendments. The IASB and FASB websites are valuable resources for the latest information.

- **Understand Differences:** Be aware of the key differences between IFRS and GAAP, as these may be tested on exams. Focus on areas where convergence efforts have been successful and where differences remain.

- **Practice Application:** Apply your knowledge through practice problems and case studies. Consider how IFRS and GAAP would impact financial reporting in different scenarios.

### Summary

The IASB and FASB play critical roles in shaping the landscape of global accounting standards. Their efforts to develop high-quality, consistent, and transparent financial reporting standards are essential for the functioning of capital markets worldwide. As you prepare for Canadian accounting exams, understanding the functions and processes of these standard-setting bodies will enhance your ability to navigate the complexities of financial reporting.
