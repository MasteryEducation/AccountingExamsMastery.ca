## 11.2 Stock Subscriptions

### Introduction to Stock Subscriptions

Stock subscriptions represent an agreement between a corporation and an investor, where the investor commits to purchasing a certain number of shares at a specified price, payable at a future date. This agreement is crucial in corporate finance as it allows companies to secure capital commitments without immediate cash inflow. Understanding stock subscriptions is essential for accounting professionals, particularly those preparing for Canadian accounting exams, as it involves recognizing and measuring equity transactions accurately.

### Accounting for Stock Subscription Agreements

#### Definition and Purpose

A stock subscription agreement is a legally binding contract wherein an investor agrees to buy shares of a company at a predetermined price. This agreement serves several purposes:

- **Capital Planning:** Companies can plan their capital needs by securing future investments.
- **Investor Commitment:** It ensures investor commitment, reducing the risk of capital shortfalls.
- **Flexibility:** Provides flexibility in managing cash flows by deferring payment.

#### Key Components of a Stock Subscription Agreement

1. **Number of Shares:** Specifies the number of shares to be purchased.
2. **Subscription Price:** The agreed price per share.
3. **Payment Terms:** Details on when and how payments will be made.
4. **Rights and Obligations:** Outlines the rights of the subscriber and obligations of the company.

#### Accounting Treatment

The accounting for stock subscriptions involves several steps, which are crucial for accurate financial reporting:

1. **Initial Recognition:**
   - Record a subscription receivable and a corresponding increase in subscribed capital stock.
   - **Journal Entry:**
     ```
     Subscription Receivable (Asset)       XXX
         Subscribed Capital Stock (Equity)       XXX
     ```

2. **Receipt of Payment:**
   - Upon receipt of payment, the subscription receivable is debited, and cash is credited.
   - **Journal Entry:**
     ```
     Cash                                   XXX
         Subscription Receivable (Asset)         XXX
     ```

3. **Issuance of Shares:**
   - Once the full payment is received, the subscribed capital stock is transferred to common stock.
   - **Journal Entry:**
     ```
     Subscribed Capital Stock (Equity)     XXX
         Common Stock (Equity)                   XXX
     ```

### Handling Subscription Receivables

#### Definition and Importance

Subscription receivables represent amounts due from investors under stock subscription agreements. They are crucial for understanding a company's future cash inflows and managing working capital.

#### Classification and Measurement

- **Classification:** Subscription receivables are classified as current or non-current assets based on the payment terms.
- **Measurement:** Initially measured at the agreed subscription price, adjusted for any impairment if collection is doubtful.

#### Accounting for Impairment

If there is doubt about the collectability of subscription receivables, an allowance for doubtful accounts should be established:

- **Journal Entry for Allowance:**
  ```
  Bad Debt Expense                        XXX
      Allowance for Doubtful Accounts          XXX
  ```

#### Practical Example

Consider a company, XYZ Corp., which enters into a stock subscription agreement with an investor for 1,000 shares at $10 per share, payable in two installments. The accounting entries would be as follows:

1. **Initial Recognition:**
   ```
   Subscription Receivable                10,000
       Subscribed Capital Stock                10,000
   ```

2. **Receipt of First Installment ($5,000):**
   ```
   Cash                                    5,000
       Subscription Receivable                  5,000
   ```

3. **Receipt of Second Installment ($5,000):**
   ```
   Cash                                    5,000
       Subscription Receivable                  5,000
   ```

4. **Issuance of Shares:**
   ```
   Subscribed Capital Stock               10,000
       Common Stock                             10,000
   ```

### Regulatory Framework and Compliance
