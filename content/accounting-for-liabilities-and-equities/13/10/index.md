## 13.10 Foreign Subsidiaries

### Introduction

In today's globalized economy, many Canadian companies operate subsidiaries in foreign countries. The consolidation of these foreign subsidiaries into the parent company's financial statements is a critical aspect of financial reporting. This section will provide a comprehensive guide to understanding the consolidation of foreign subsidiaries and the translation of their financial statements into the reporting currency of the parent company. We will explore the relevant accounting standards, practical examples, and the implications of currency translation on financial reporting.

### Understanding Foreign Subsidiaries

A foreign subsidiary is a company that is controlled by a parent company but operates in a different country. The parent company typically owns more than 50% of the subsidiary's voting shares, giving it control over the subsidiary's operations and financial policies. The financial statements of foreign subsidiaries must be consolidated with the parent company's financial statements to provide a complete picture of the financial position and performance of the entire corporate group.

### The Need for Consolidation

Consolidation is necessary to present the financial statements of a parent company and its subsidiaries as if they were a single economic entity. This process involves combining the financial statements of the parent and its subsidiaries, eliminating intercompany transactions and balances, and applying uniform accounting policies. Consolidation ensures that the financial statements reflect the true financial position and performance of the entire group, rather than just the parent company.

### Currency Translation

One of the key challenges in consolidating foreign subsidiaries is the translation of financial statements from the subsidiary's functional currency to the parent company's reporting currency. The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates, while the reporting currency is the currency in which the parent company presents its financial statements.

#### Translation Methods

There are two primary methods for translating foreign currency financial statements:

1. **Current Rate Method**: This method involves translating all assets and liabilities at the current exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Income statement items are translated at the average exchange rate for the period. This method is typically used when the foreign subsidiary operates relatively independently of the parent company.

2. **Temporal Method**: This method translates monetary items at the current exchange rate and non-monetary items at historical exchange rates. Income statement items are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the time of the transaction. This method is used when the foreign subsidiary is closely integrated with the parent company.

#### Translation Adjustments

Translation adjustments arise from the difference in exchange rates used to translate the financial statements. These adjustments are recorded in a separate component of equity known as the cumulative translation adjustment (CTA). The CTA reflects the impact of changes in exchange rates on the net assets of the foreign subsidiary.

### Accounting Standards for Foreign Subsidiaries

In Canada, the accounting standards for the consolidation of foreign subsidiaries are governed by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted in Canada, specifically IFRS 10, Consolidated Financial Statements, and IAS 21, The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates. For private enterprises, the Accounting Standards for Private Enterprises (ASPE) provide guidance on consolidation and currency translation.

#### IFRS 10: Consolidated Financial Statements

IFRS 10 establishes principles for the presentation and preparation of consolidated financial statements when an entity controls one or more other entities. It requires the use of uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances. IFRS 10 also requires the elimination of intercompany transactions and balances in the consolidated financial statements.

#### IAS 21: The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates

IAS 21 provides guidance on how to account for foreign currency transactions and how to translate the financial statements of foreign operations. It outlines the criteria for determining the functional currency and provides guidance on translating financial statements into the reporting currency.

#### ASPE 1651: Foreign Currency Translation

For private enterprises in Canada, ASPE 1651 provides guidance on the translation of financial statements of foreign operations. It outlines the use of the temporal method for translating financial statements and the recognition of exchange gains and losses in net income.

### Practical Example: Consolidating a Foreign Subsidiary

Let's consider a practical example of a Canadian parent company, Maple Corp, which owns a foreign subsidiary, EuroTech, operating in Europe. EuroTech's functional currency is the Euro, while Maple Corp's reporting currency is the Canadian Dollar (CAD).

#### Step 1: Determine the Functional Currency

The first step in consolidating EuroTech's financial statements is to determine its functional currency. This involves assessing the primary economic environment in which EuroTech operates, including factors such as the currency that influences sales prices and labor costs.

#### Step 2: Translate the Financial Statements

Once the functional currency is determined, EuroTech's financial statements are translated into CAD using the current rate method. All assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate at the balance sheet date, while income statement items are translated at the average exchange rate for the period.

#### Step 3: Eliminate Intercompany Transactions

Maple Corp must eliminate any intercompany transactions and balances between itself and EuroTech. This includes eliminating intercompany sales, loans, and other transactions to avoid double counting in the consolidated financial statements.

#### Step 4: Record Translation Adjustments

Translation adjustments arising from the translation of EuroTech's financial statements are recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment (CTA) account within equity. This reflects the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the net assets of EuroTech.

#### Step 5: Prepare Consolidated Financial Statements

Finally, Maple Corp prepares its consolidated financial statements, combining its own financial statements with those of EuroTech. The consolidated financial statements present the financial position and performance of the entire corporate group as a single economic entity.

### Regulatory Compliance and Disclosure Requirements

When consolidating foreign subsidiaries, it is essential to comply with the relevant accounting standards and regulatory requirements. This includes providing adequate disclosures in the financial statements regarding the consolidation process, translation methods used, and the impact of exchange rate fluctuations.

#### Disclosure Requirements

The financial statements must disclose the following information:

- The functional currency of the foreign subsidiary and the reporting currency of the parent company.
- The translation method used and any changes in the method from the previous period.
- The amount of translation adjustments recognized in equity and their impact on the financial statements.

### Challenges and Best Practices

Consolidating foreign subsidiaries presents several challenges, including currency translation, intercompany transactions, and compliance with different accounting standards. To overcome these challenges, companies should adopt best practices such as:

- Regularly reviewing and updating accounting policies to ensure consistency across the corporate group.
- Implementing robust internal controls to manage intercompany transactions and ensure accurate consolidation.
- Engaging with professional advisors and auditors to ensure compliance with accounting standards and regulatory requirements.

### Exam Focus and Key Takeaways

For the Canadian Accounting Exams, it is crucial to understand the principles of consolidating foreign subsidiaries and the translation of financial statements. Key takeaways include:

- Understanding the difference between the current rate method and the temporal method for currency translation.
- Recognizing the importance of eliminating intercompany transactions in the consolidation process.
