## 6.2 Held-to-Maturity Investments

### Introduction

Held-to-Maturity (HTM) investments are a crucial component of financial accounting, particularly for entities that invest in debt securities with the intent and ability to hold them until maturity. This section provides a comprehensive exploration of HTM investments, focusing on the recognition, measurement, and reporting of these financial instruments. We will delve into the accounting principles and standards applicable in Canada, including the amortization of premiums and discounts, and provide practical examples to illustrate key concepts.

### Understanding Held-to-Maturity Investments

**Definition and Characteristics**

HTM investments are debt securities that an entity has the positive intent and ability to hold until they mature. Unlike trading securities or available-for-sale securities, HTM investments are not subject to frequent buying and selling. Instead, they are held for the duration of their term, which provides a predictable stream of cash flows in the form of interest payments and the return of principal at maturity.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Fixed Maturity Date:** HTM securities have a specified maturity date.
- **Fixed or Determinable Payments:** They provide fixed or determinable payments.
- **Intent and Ability to Hold:** The entity must have both the intent and the ability to hold the securities until maturity.

### Accounting for Held-to-Maturity Investments

**Initial Recognition and Measurement**

Upon acquisition, HTM investments are initially recognized at cost, which includes the purchase price plus any directly attributable transaction costs. This initial cost forms the basis for subsequent measurement.

**Amortization of Premiums and Discounts**

HTM investments are carried at amortized cost. If a security is purchased at a premium (above par value) or a discount (below par value), the premium or discount is amortized over the life of the security using the effective interest rate method. This method ensures that the interest income recognized each period reflects the constant yield on the investment.

**Effective Interest Rate Method:**

The effective interest rate method involves calculating the interest income by applying the effective interest rate to the amortized cost of the investment. This rate is the discount rate that equates the present value of the expected cash flows from the investment to its initial carrying amount.

**Example:**

Consider a bond with a face value of $1,000, a coupon rate of 5%, and a market rate of 6%. If the bond is purchased at a discount for $950, the effective interest rate method will be used to amortize the $50 discount over the bond's life.

**Journal Entries:**

- **Initial Recognition:**
  ```
  Debit: Held-to-Maturity Investments $950
  Credit: Cash $950
  ```

- **Interest Income Recognition:**
  ```
  Debit: Cash $50
  Debit: Held-to-Maturity Investments $7
  Credit: Interest Income $57
  ```

**Subsequent Measurement**

After initial recognition, HTM investments are measured at amortized cost. The carrying amount is adjusted for the amortization of any premium or discount and any impairment losses recognized.

### Impairment of Held-to-Maturity Investments

**Recognition of Impairment**

An HTM investment is considered impaired if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the investment. The impairment loss is measured as the difference between the investment's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.

**Journal Entry for Impairment:**

```
Debit: Impairment Loss on Investments
Credit: Held-to-Maturity Investments
```

**Reversal of Impairment**

Under Canadian accounting standards, if in a subsequent period the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognized, the previously recognized impairment loss is reversed.

### Derecognition of Held-to-Maturity Investments

HTM investments are derecognized when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the investment expire or when the investment is sold or otherwise disposed of. Upon derecognition, any difference between the carrying amount and the consideration received is recognized in profit or loss.

**Journal Entry for Derecognition:**

```
Debit: Cash
Credit: Held-to-Maturity Investments
Credit: Gain on Sale of Investments (if applicable)
```

### Compliance with Canadian Accounting Standards

**IFRS and ASPE**

In Canada, HTM investments are accounted for under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by CPA Canada. The relevant standards include IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, which outlines the classification and measurement of financial instruments, including HTM investments.

**Key Considerations:**

- **Classification:** Under IFRS 9, HTM investments are classified as financial assets at amortized cost if they meet the criteria of the business model test and the cash flow characteristics test.
- **Business Model Test:** The entity must hold the financial asset to collect contractual cash flows.
- **Cash Flow Characteristics Test:** The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

### Practical Examples and Case Studies

**Example 1: Corporate Bond Investment**

A Canadian corporation invests in a corporate bond with a face value of $100,000, a coupon rate of 4%, and a market rate of 5%. The bond is purchased at a discount for $95,000. The corporation intends to hold the bond until maturity, which is in five years.

**Amortization Schedule:**

| Year | Beginning Balance | Interest Income | Cash Received | Amortization | Ending Balance |
|------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------|--------------|----------------|
| 1    | $95,000           | $4,750          | $4,000        | $750         | $95,750        |
| 2    | $95,750           | $4,788          | $4,000        | $788         | $96,538        |
| 3    | $96,538           | $4,827          | $4,000        | $827         | $97,365        |
| 4    | $97,365           | $4,868          | $4,000        | $868         | $98,233        |
| 5    | $98,233           | $4,912          | $4,000        | $912         | $99,145        |

**Example 2: Impairment Scenario**

A company holds an HTM investment in a government bond. Due to a significant downgrade in the government's credit rating, the company assesses the bond for impairment. The present value of the estimated future cash flows is calculated to be $90,000, while the carrying amount is $95,000.

**Impairment Loss Calculation:**

Carrying Amount: $95,000  
Present Value of Future Cash Flows: $90,000  
Impairment Loss: $5,000

**Journal Entry:**

```
Debit: Impairment Loss on Investments $5,000
Credit: Held-to-Maturity Investments $5,000
```

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

**Best Practices:**

- **Regularly Review Intent and Ability:** Ensure that the intent and ability to hold investments to maturity are regularly reviewed and documented.
- **Effective Interest Rate Method:** Use the effective interest rate method consistently for amortizing premiums and discounts.
- **Impairment Assessment:** Conduct regular assessments for impairment, especially in volatile economic conditions.

**Common Pitfalls:**

- **Misclassification:** Avoid misclassifying investments as HTM if there is any doubt about the intent or ability to hold them to maturity.
- **Inconsistent Amortization:** Ensure consistent application of the effective interest rate method to avoid discrepancies in financial reporting.
- **Neglecting Impairment Indicators:** Be vigilant about changes in market conditions or credit ratings that may indicate impairment.

### Regulatory Considerations and Compliance
