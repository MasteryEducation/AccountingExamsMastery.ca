## 6.11 Fair Value Measurement

Fair value measurement is a critical concept in accounting, particularly when it comes to investment securities. It provides a standardized approach to valuing assets and liabilities, ensuring transparency and comparability in financial reporting. This section delves into the hierarchy of fair value measurements, its application to investment securities, and its significance in the context of Canadian accounting standards.

### Understanding Fair Value

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. This definition emphasizes the market-based measurement of value, rather than an entity-specific measurement.

#### Key Characteristics of Fair Value

- **Market-Based Measurement**: Fair value is determined based on market conditions and participant perspectives, not on the entity's own intentions or circumstances.
- **Exit Price**: It reflects the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability, not the price to acquire or assume it.
- **Orderly Transaction**: Assumes a transaction in the principal (or most advantageous) market under normal conditions.
- **Measurement Date**: Fair value is specific to a particular date, capturing the market conditions at that time.

### The Fair Value Hierarchy

The fair value hierarchy is a framework that categorizes the inputs used in valuation techniques into three levels, prioritizing observable inputs over unobservable inputs.

#### Level 1 Inputs

Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date. These inputs provide the most reliable evidence of fair value and should be used whenever available.

**Examples**: 
- Quoted prices for equity securities on a stock exchange.
- Prices of commodities traded on a futures exchange.

#### Level 2 Inputs

Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These inputs include:

- Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets.
- Quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active.
- Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, such as interest rates and yield curves.

**Examples**:
- Interest rate swaps valued using observable yield curves.
- Real estate valued using market comparables.

#### Level 3 Inputs

Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. These inputs reflect the entity's own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk.

**Examples**:
- Private equity investments.
- Complex financial instruments with no active market.

### Application to Investment Securities

Investment securities are often measured at fair value, particularly under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Accounting Standards for Private Enterprises (ASPE) in Canada. The application of fair value measurement to these securities involves several steps and considerations.

#### Classification of Investment Securities

Investment securities are classified into different categories based on the business model for managing them and their contractual cash flow characteristics. Under IFRS 9, these categories include:

- **Amortized Cost**: For securities held to collect contractual cash flows.
- **Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI)**: For securities held both to collect cash flows and to sell.
- **Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL)**: For securities not meeting the criteria for the other categories.

#### Valuation Techniques

Valuation techniques used to measure fair value should maximize the use of relevant observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Common techniques include:

- **Market Approach**: Uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities.
- **Income Approach**: Converts future amounts (e.g., cash flows or income and expenses) to a single current (discounted) amount.
- **Cost Approach**: Reflects the amount that would be required currently to replace the service capacity of an asset (often referred to as current replacement cost).

#### Practical Example

Consider a company holding a portfolio of investment securities, including publicly traded stocks, corporate bonds, and private equity investments. The fair value measurement process would involve:

1. **Publicly Traded Stocks**: Use Level 1 inputs by referencing quoted market prices on the stock exchange.
2. **Corporate Bonds**: Use Level 2 inputs by referencing quoted prices for similar bonds or yield curves.
3. **Private Equity Investments**: Use Level 3 inputs, applying the income approach with discounted cash flow analysis.

### Regulatory Framework and Compliance

In Canada, fair value measurement is governed by IFRS, which has been adopted for publicly accountable enterprises. Private enterprises may choose to apply ASPE, which also incorporates fair value concepts but with some differences in application.

#### IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement

IFRS 13 provides a comprehensive framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures about fair value measurements. Key aspects include:

- **Disclosure Requirements**: Entities must disclose information that helps users assess the valuation techniques and inputs used, including the level of the fair value hierarchy.
- **Valuation Techniques**: Entities must use valuation techniques consistent with the market, income, and cost approaches.
- **Fair Value Adjustments**: Consideration of factors such as the condition and location of the asset, restrictions on its sale or use, and the entity's credit risk.

#### ASPE Section 3856 Financial Instruments

ASPE Section 3856 outlines the requirements for recognizing, measuring, and disclosing financial instruments, including fair value measurement. While similar to IFRS, ASPE allows for some simplifications and exemptions for private enterprises.

### Challenges and Best Practices

Fair value measurement can present challenges, particularly when dealing with Level 3 inputs and complex financial instruments. Best practices to address these challenges include:

- **Robust Valuation Processes**: Implementing strong internal controls and governance over the valuation process.
- **Use of Experts**: Engaging valuation specialists for complex or significant valuations.
- **Regular Review and Calibration**: Continuously reviewing and calibrating valuation models and assumptions to reflect current market conditions.

### Real-World Applications

Fair value measurement is not only a theoretical concept but also has practical implications in various industries and sectors. For instance:

- **Financial Institutions**: Banks and investment firms use fair value measurement extensively for their trading portfolios and derivative instruments.
- **Real Estate**: Real estate companies apply fair value measurement to investment properties, affecting their financial statements and investor perceptions.
- **Insurance**: Insurers use fair value to assess the value of their investment portfolios and liabilities, impacting their solvency and regulatory compliance.

### Case Study: Fair Value Measurement in a Canadian Bank

Consider a Canadian bank that holds a diverse portfolio of financial instruments, including government bonds, corporate loans, and derivative contracts. The bank's fair value measurement process involves:

1. **Government Bonds**: Valued using Level 1 inputs from active bond markets.
2. **Corporate Loans**: Valued using Level 2 inputs, such as market comparables and credit spreads.
3. **Derivative Contracts**: Valued using Level 3 inputs, incorporating complex models and assumptions about future market conditions.

The bank's financial statements include detailed disclosures about the fair value hierarchy, valuation techniques, and sensitivity analyses, providing transparency to investors and regulators.

### Conclusion

Fair value measurement is a fundamental aspect of accounting for liabilities and equities, providing a market-based perspective on asset and liability valuation. Understanding the fair value hierarchy, applying appropriate valuation techniques, and complying with regulatory requirements are essential for accurate and transparent financial reporting.

By mastering fair value measurement, you will be well-equipped to handle investment securities and other financial instruments in both exam scenarios and professional practice.
