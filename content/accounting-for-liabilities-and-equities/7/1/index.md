## 7.1 Lessee Accounting under ASC 842/IFRS 16

### Introduction

Lessee accounting under ASC 842 and IFRS 16 represents a significant shift in how leases are recognized and reported in financial statements. These standards aim to increase transparency and comparability by requiring lessees to recognize almost all leases on the balance sheet. This section will guide you through the key concepts, measurement techniques, and reporting requirements for lessees under these standards, with a focus on practical applications and examples relevant to Canadian accounting practices.

### Overview of ASC 842 and IFRS 16

ASC 842 and IFRS 16 are accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), respectively. Both standards require lessees to recognize a right-of-use (ROU) asset and a corresponding lease liability for most leases. This approach eliminates the distinction between operating and finance leases for lessees, which was a hallmark of the previous standards.

#### Key Objectives

- **Transparency:** Enhance the visibility of lease obligations on the balance sheet.
- **Comparability:** Standardize lease accounting across industries and jurisdictions.
- **Consistency:** Align lessee accounting practices with the economic realities of lease transactions.

### Core Concepts

#### Right-of-Use Asset

The ROU asset represents the lessee's right to use the leased asset over the lease term. It is initially measured at the present value of lease payments, adjusted for any lease incentives received, initial direct costs, and restoration obligations.

#### Lease Liability

The lease liability is the obligation to make lease payments. It is measured at the present value of future lease payments, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, the lessee's incremental borrowing rate.

### Recognition and Measurement

#### Initial Recognition

Upon lease commencement, lessees must recognize:

- **ROU Asset:** Initially measured at cost, which includes the initial measurement of the lease liability, lease payments made at or before the commencement date, any initial direct costs, and an estimate of costs to dismantle or restore the asset.
- **Lease Liability:** Initially measured at the present value of lease payments over the lease term.

##### Example: Initial Measurement

Consider a lease agreement for a piece of equipment with the following terms:

- Lease term: 5 years
- Annual lease payment: $10,000
- Lessee's incremental borrowing rate: 5%

The present value of lease payments is calculated as follows:

{{< katex >}}
PV = \frac{10,000}{(1+0.05)^1} + \frac{10,000}{(1+0.05)^2} + \frac{10,000}{(1+0.05)^3} + \frac{10,000}{(1+0.05)^4} + \frac{10,000}{(1+0.05)^5}
{{< /katex >}}

Using a financial calculator or spreadsheet, the present value is approximately $43,295. This amount is recognized as both the ROU asset and the lease liability.

#### Subsequent Measurement

- **ROU Asset:** Amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term unless another systematic basis better represents the pattern of use.
- **Lease Liability:** Increased by interest expense and decreased by lease payments made.

##### Example: Subsequent Measurement

Continuing the previous example, the ROU asset is amortized over 5 years. The lease liability is adjusted annually for interest and payments:

- Year 1: Interest = $43,295 * 5% = $2,165
- Lease payment = $10,000
- Lease liability at end of Year 1 = $43,295 + $2,165 - $10,000 = $35,460

### Lease Modifications and Reassessments

Lease modifications occur when there is a change in the scope or consideration of a lease that was not part of the original terms. Reassessments are required when there is a change in the lease term or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset.

#### Accounting for Modifications

- **Increase in Scope:** Account for as a separate lease if the modification grants an additional right of use.
- **Decrease in Scope:** Adjust the lease liability and ROU asset, recognizing any gain or loss in profit or loss.

#### Example: Lease Modification

Suppose a lessee extends the lease term by 2 years with an additional annual payment of $5,000. The modification is not accounted for as a separate lease. The lessee remeasures the lease liability using the revised lease payments and discount rate.

### Presentation and Disclosure

#### Balance Sheet

- **ROU Asset:** Presented separately or included with similar assets.
- **Lease Liability:** Presented separately or included with similar liabilities.

#### Income Statement

- **Amortization of ROU Asset:** Presented as depreciation expense.
- **Interest on Lease Liability:** Presented as interest expense.

#### Cash Flow Statement

- **Principal Payments:** Classified within financing activities.
- **Interest Payments:** Classified according to the lessee's accounting policy (operating or financing activities).

#### Disclosure Requirements

Lessees must provide qualitative and quantitative disclosures to enable users to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. Key disclosures include:

- Nature of leasing activities
- Maturity analysis of lease liabilities
- Significant judgments and assumptions

### Practical Examples and Case Studies

#### Case Study: Retail Store Lease

A Canadian retail company enters into a 10-year lease for a store location with annual payments of $50,000. The lease includes an option to renew for an additional 5 years. The company uses an incremental borrowing rate of 4%.

- **Initial Recognition:** Calculate the present value of lease payments for the initial 10-year term.
- **Subsequent Measurement:** Amortize the ROU asset and adjust the lease liability annually.
- **Disclosure:** Provide details on the lease term, renewal options, and assumptions used in measurement.

### Common Challenges and Pitfalls

- **Determining the Discount Rate:** Selecting an appropriate discount rate can be challenging, especially when the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable.
- **Identifying Lease Components:** Properly identifying and separating lease and non-lease components can be complex, particularly in contracts with multiple elements.
- **Reassessing Lease Terms:** Regularly reassessing lease terms and options requires careful judgment and documentation.

### Best Practices and Strategies

- **Maintain Detailed Records:** Keep comprehensive records of lease agreements, modifications, and reassessments.
- **Leverage Technology:** Use lease accounting software to automate calculations and ensure compliance.
- **Regular Training:** Provide ongoing training for accounting staff to stay updated on standards and best practices.

### Regulatory Considerations

In Canada, IFRS 16 is the applicable standard for publicly accountable enterprises, while private enterprises may choose to apply ASPE. It is crucial to understand the differences and ensure compliance with the appropriate framework.

### Conclusion

Lessee accounting under ASC 842 and IFRS 16 requires a thorough understanding of the standards and careful application of principles to accurately recognize and measure lease transactions. By mastering these concepts, you will be well-prepared for the Canadian Accounting Exams and equipped to handle lease accounting in professional practice.
