## 7.9 Impact on Financial Ratios and Covenants

Lease accounting is a critical area in financial reporting that significantly impacts financial ratios and compliance with debt covenants. Understanding these impacts is essential for those preparing for Canadian accounting exams, as well as for professionals in the field. This section provides a comprehensive analysis of how lease accounting under IFRS 16 and ASC 842 affects key financial ratios and debt covenants, offering practical examples and guidance to help you master this topic.

### Understanding Lease Accounting Standards

Lease accounting has undergone significant changes with the introduction of IFRS 16 and ASC 842, which aim to increase transparency and comparability in financial reporting. Both standards require lessees to recognize most leases on the balance sheet, leading to significant changes in financial statements and ratios.

#### IFRS 16 Overview

Under IFRS 16, lessees must recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for most leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. This change eliminates the distinction between operating and finance leases for lessees, impacting financial ratios such as leverage and liquidity.

#### ASC 842 Overview

ASC 842, the US counterpart to IFRS 16, also requires lessees to recognize lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. However, it retains the distinction between operating and finance leases for income statement purposes, affecting how lease expenses are recognized and impacting profitability ratios.

### Key Financial Ratios Affected by Lease Accounting

Lease accounting affects several key financial ratios, which are critical for financial analysis and decision-making. Understanding these impacts is essential for compliance with debt covenants and effective financial management.

#### 1. Leverage Ratios

Leverage ratios, such as the debt-to-equity ratio and the debt ratio, are directly impacted by the recognition of lease liabilities. The inclusion of lease liabilities increases total debt, potentially affecting a company's leverage position and its ability to meet debt covenants.

- **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:** This ratio measures the proportion of debt to shareholders' equity. Recognizing lease liabilities increases total debt, leading to a higher debt-to-equity ratio. This change can affect a company's perceived risk and its ability to attract investors.

- **Debt Ratio:** The debt ratio, calculated as total debt divided by total assets, also increases with the recognition of lease liabilities. This change can impact a company's credit rating and borrowing capacity.

#### 2. Liquidity Ratios

Liquidity ratios, such as the current ratio and quick ratio, are affected by the recognition of lease liabilities, particularly the current portion of lease liabilities.

- **Current Ratio:** The current ratio, calculated as current assets divided by current liabilities, may decrease if the current portion of lease liabilities is significant. This change can impact a company's short-term financial health and its ability to meet short-term obligations.

- **Quick Ratio:** Similar to the current ratio, the quick ratio may also decrease due to the inclusion of lease liabilities, affecting a company's liquidity position.

#### 3. Profitability Ratios

Profitability ratios, such as the return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE), are impacted by changes in lease accounting, particularly due to the recognition of depreciation and interest expenses.

- **Return on Assets (ROA):** ROA, calculated as net income divided by total assets, may decrease as total assets increase with the recognition of right-of-use assets. This change can affect a company's efficiency in using its assets to generate profits.

- **Return on Equity (ROE):** ROE, calculated as net income divided by shareholders' equity, may also be affected if lease expenses impact net income. This change can influence a company's attractiveness to investors.

#### 4. Coverage Ratios

Coverage ratios, such as the interest coverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio, are affected by the recognition of interest expenses related to lease liabilities.

- **Interest Coverage Ratio:** This ratio, calculated as earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) divided by interest expenses, may decrease if interest expenses related to lease liabilities are significant. This change can impact a company's ability to meet interest obligations.

- **Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio:** Similar to the interest coverage ratio, the fixed charge coverage ratio may also decrease due to lease-related expenses, affecting a company's financial stability.

### Practical Examples and Case Studies

To illustrate the impact of lease accounting on financial ratios, consider the following examples:

#### Example 1: Impact on Leverage Ratios

A company with $1 million in total debt and $2 million in equity recognizes a lease liability of $500,000. The debt-to-equity ratio increases from 0.5 to 0.75, affecting the company's leverage position and its ability to meet debt covenants.

#### Example 2: Impact on Liquidity Ratios

A company with $1 million in current assets and $500,000 in current liabilities recognizes a current lease liability of $100,000. The current ratio decreases from 2.0 to 1.67, impacting the company's short-term financial health.

#### Example 3: Impact on Profitability Ratios

A company with $5 million in total assets and $500,000 in net income recognizes a right-of-use asset of $1 million. The ROA decreases from 10% to 8.33%, affecting the company's efficiency in using its assets to generate profits.

### Compliance with Debt Covenants

Debt covenants are agreements between a borrower and a lender that impose certain restrictions on the borrower to protect the lender's interests. Lease accounting can impact a company's ability to comply with these covenants, particularly those related to financial ratios.

#### Types of Debt Covenants

Debt covenants can be classified into two main categories: affirmative covenants and negative covenants.

- **Affirmative Covenants:** These covenants require the borrower to take specific actions, such as maintaining certain financial ratios or providing regular financial statements.

- **Negative Covenants:** These covenants restrict the borrower from taking certain actions, such as incurring additional debt or making significant asset sales.

#### Impact of Lease Accounting on Debt Covenants

Lease accounting can impact a company's ability to comply with debt covenants in several ways:

- **Leverage Covenants:** Covenants that require the borrower to maintain certain leverage ratios may be affected by the recognition of lease liabilities, potentially leading to covenant breaches.

- **Liquidity Covenants:** Covenants that require the borrower to maintain certain liquidity ratios may also be impacted by lease accounting, affecting the company's ability to meet short-term obligations.

- **Profitability Covenants:** Covenants that require the borrower to achieve certain profitability levels may be affected by changes in lease-related expenses, impacting the company's financial performance.

### Strategies for Managing the Impact of Lease Accounting

To manage the impact of lease accounting on financial ratios and debt covenants, companies can consider the following strategies:

#### 1. Renegotiating Debt Covenants

Companies can renegotiate debt covenants with lenders to account for the impact of lease accounting. This may involve adjusting covenant thresholds or excluding lease liabilities from certain ratio calculations.

#### 2. Improving Financial Ratios

Companies can take steps to improve financial ratios, such as increasing equity through retained earnings or reducing debt through asset sales. These actions can help mitigate the impact of lease accounting on financial ratios.

#### 3. Enhancing Financial Reporting

Companies can enhance financial reporting by providing detailed disclosures about lease accounting and its impact on financial statements. This can help stakeholders understand the changes and make informed decisions.

### Regulatory Considerations and Compliance

Lease accounting is subject to regulatory requirements and compliance considerations, particularly in the context of Canadian accounting standards.

#### IFRS 16 Compliance

IFRS 16 requires companies to provide detailed disclosures about lease accounting, including the nature and terms of leases, the impact on financial statements, and the assumptions used in lease calculations. Compliance with these requirements is essential for accurate financial reporting.

#### ASC 842 Compliance

ASC 842 also requires detailed disclosures about lease accounting, including the classification of leases, the impact on financial statements, and the assumptions used in lease calculations. Compliance with these requirements is critical for transparency and comparability.

### Conclusion

Lease accounting has a significant impact on financial ratios and compliance with debt covenants, affecting a company's financial health and its ability to meet obligations. Understanding these impacts is essential for those preparing for Canadian accounting exams and for professionals in the field. By mastering the concepts and strategies outlined in this section, you can enhance your financial analysis skills and improve your ability to manage the impact of lease accounting on financial statements.
