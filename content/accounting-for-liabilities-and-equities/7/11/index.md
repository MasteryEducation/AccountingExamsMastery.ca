## 7.11 Short-term and Low-value Leases

### Introduction

In the realm of lease accounting, short-term and low-value leases offer a practical expedient that simplifies the accounting process. These leases, characterized by their brevity or minimal value, allow lessees to bypass the complex recognition and measurement requirements typically associated with lease liabilities and right-of-use assets. This section delves into the intricacies of short-term and low-value leases, providing a comprehensive understanding of their treatment under Canadian accounting standards, particularly IFRS 16 and ASC 842. By exploring practical examples, regulatory considerations, and real-world applications, you will gain a robust understanding of how to effectively manage these leases in financial reporting.

### Understanding Short-term and Low-value Leases

#### Definition and Scope

**Short-term Leases:** According to IFRS 16, a short-term lease is one with a lease term of 12 months or less at the commencement date, without any purchase options. This definition allows lessees to exclude such leases from the balance sheet, treating lease payments as an expense over the lease term.

**Low-value Leases:** Low-value leases pertain to assets that are individually of low value, typically below a threshold set by the accounting standard. Examples include office furniture, personal computers, and small office equipment. The low-value exemption applies regardless of whether the lease is short-term.

#### Practical Expedients

The practical expedients for short-term and low-value leases provide relief from the rigorous requirements of recognizing lease liabilities and right-of-use assets. Instead, lease payments are recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis or another systematic basis over the lease term.

### Accounting Treatment

#### Recognition and Measurement

1. **Short-term Leases:**
   - **Expense Recognition:** Lessees can elect to recognize lease payments as an expense over the lease term, avoiding the need to record a lease liability or right-of-use asset.
   - **Disclosure Requirements:** While balance sheet recognition is not required, lessees must disclose the expense related to short-term leases in the financial statements.

2. **Low-value Leases:**
   - **Expense Treatment:** Similar to short-term leases, lessees recognize lease payments as an expense, simplifying the accounting process.
   - **Materiality Considerations:** The low-value exemption is based on materiality, allowing lessees to focus on more significant leases.

#### Practical Example

Consider a company that leases office furniture valued at $1,000 for a period of 10 months. Under the low-value lease exemption, the company can recognize the lease payments as an expense over the lease term, avoiding the complexity of recording a right-of-use asset or lease liability.

### Regulatory Framework

#### IFRS 16 and ASC 842

Both IFRS 16 and ASC 842 provide guidance on the treatment of short-term and low-value leases, emphasizing the importance of materiality and cost-benefit considerations. These standards aim to simplify lease accounting while ensuring transparency and comparability in financial reporting.

#### Canadian Accounting Standards

In Canada, the adoption of IFRS 16 aligns with international practices, providing consistency in the treatment of leases. The Accounting Standards for Private Enterprises (ASPE) also offer guidance on lease accounting, allowing for practical expedients similar to those under IFRS 16.

### Real-world Applications

#### Industry-specific Considerations

- **Retail Sector:** Retailers often engage in short-term leases for temporary store locations or kiosks, benefiting from the practical expedients to streamline their accounting processes.
- **Technology Companies:** Companies in the tech industry frequently lease low-value assets such as laptops and office equipment, utilizing the low-value lease exemption to reduce administrative burdens.

#### Case Study: Retail Chain

A Canadian retail chain leases several kiosks in shopping malls for seasonal sales. These leases, typically lasting 6 to 9 months, qualify as short-term leases. By applying the short-term lease exemption, the chain can recognize lease payments as an expense, simplifying its financial reporting and focusing on core business operations.

### Challenges and Best Practices

#### Common Pitfalls

- **Misclassification:** Incorrectly classifying leases as short-term or low-value can lead to non-compliance with accounting standards.
- **Inadequate Disclosure:** Failing to disclose the impact of short-term and low-value leases in financial statements can result in a lack of transparency.

#### Strategies for Compliance

- **Regular Review:** Conduct periodic reviews of lease agreements to ensure proper classification and compliance with accounting standards.
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Maintain detailed records of lease agreements and the rationale for applying practical expedients.

### Exam Strategies and Tips

- **Understand Definitions:** Familiarize yourself with the definitions and criteria for short-term and low-value leases under IFRS 16 and ASC 842.
- **Practice Scenarios:** Work through practical examples and case studies to reinforce your understanding of the accounting treatment for these leases.
- **Focus on Disclosure:** Pay attention to the disclosure requirements for short-term and low-value leases, as these are often tested in exams.

### Conclusion

Short-term and low-value leases offer a valuable simplification in lease accounting, allowing lessees to focus on more significant financial reporting matters. By understanding the practical expedients available and applying them correctly, you can streamline your accounting processes and ensure compliance with Canadian accounting standards. As you prepare for the Canadian Accounting Exams, remember to emphasize the importance of materiality, transparency, and compliance in your lease accounting practices.
