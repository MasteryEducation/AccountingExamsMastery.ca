## 7.6 Sale and Leaseback Transactions

### Introduction

Sale and leaseback transactions are a unique financial arrangement where an entity sells an asset and then leases it back from the buyer. This type of transaction is prevalent in various industries, including real estate, aviation, and manufacturing, as it allows companies to unlock the capital tied up in fixed assets while retaining the use of those assets. Understanding the accounting treatment of sale and leaseback transactions is crucial for financial reporting and compliance with Canadian accounting standards.

### Overview of Sale and Leaseback Transactions

In a sale and leaseback transaction, the seller transfers ownership of an asset to a buyer and simultaneously enters into a lease agreement to continue using the asset. This arrangement can provide liquidity and improve financial ratios by converting fixed assets into cash while retaining operational flexibility.

#### Key Components

1. **Sale Component**: The initial sale of the asset, which must be recognized according to the applicable accounting standards.
2. **Leaseback Component**: The lease agreement that follows the sale, which must be accounted for under lease accounting standards.

#### Benefits and Risks

- **Benefits**: Improved liquidity, potential tax advantages, and off-balance-sheet financing.
- **Risks**: Potential loss of control over the asset, long-term lease obligations, and impact on financial statements.

### Accounting Standards for Sale and Leaseback Transactions

The accounting treatment of sale and leaseback transactions is governed by IFRS 16 "Leases" and ASC 842 in the United States. In Canada, IFRS 16 is the primary standard for lease accounting.

#### IFRS 16: Leases

Under IFRS 16, the accounting treatment depends on whether the sale qualifies as a sale under IFRS 15 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers." If the sale is recognized, the transaction is treated as a sale and leaseback. If not, it is treated as a financing transaction.

**Key Considerations:**

- **Transfer of Control**: The seller must determine if control of the asset has transferred to the buyer.
- **Lease Classification**: The leaseback must be classified as either an operating lease or a finance lease.

#### ASC 842: Leases

ASC 842 provides similar guidance for sale and leaseback transactions in the United States, focusing on the transfer of control and lease classification.

### Accounting Treatment

#### Sale Recognition

To recognize a sale, the seller must evaluate whether the transfer of control criteria under IFRS 15 are met. This involves assessing the buyer's ability to direct the use of the asset and obtain substantially all the remaining benefits.

**Example:**

A company sells a building to a financial institution and leases it back for 10 years. The sale is recognized if the financial institution gains control of the building, evidenced by the ability to lease it to others or use it for its purposes.

#### Leaseback Accounting

Once the sale is recognized, the leaseback is accounted for under IFRS 16. The seller-lessee must determine whether the lease is an operating lease or a finance lease.

- **Operating Lease**: The asset remains off the balance sheet, and lease payments are recognized as an expense.
- **Finance Lease**: The asset is recognized on the balance sheet, and lease payments are split between interest expense and principal repayment.

#### Measurement and Recognition

- **Initial Measurement**: The right-of-use asset and lease liability are initially measured at the present value of lease payments.
- **Subsequent Measurement**: The right-of-use asset is depreciated, and the lease liability is reduced as payments are made.

### Practical Examples and Scenarios

#### Real Estate Sale and Leaseback

Consider a retail company that sells its store property to a real estate investment trust (REIT) and leases it back. This transaction allows the company to free up capital for expansion while continuing to operate from the same location.

**Accounting Steps:**

1. **Recognize Sale**: Determine if the REIT gains control under IFRS 15.
2. **Classify Lease**: Assess whether the leaseback is an operating or finance lease.
3. **Record Leaseback**: Measure and recognize the right-of-use asset and lease liability.

#### Aviation Industry Example

An airline sells its aircraft to a leasing company and leases them back. This is a common practice to manage fleet costs and improve liquidity.

**Key Considerations:**

- **Transfer of Control**: Evaluate if the leasing company has control over the aircraft.
- **Leaseback Terms**: Analyze the lease terms to determine classification.

### Regulatory Considerations

#### Canadian Accounting Standards

In Canada, sale and leaseback transactions must comply with IFRS 16, which emphasizes the transfer of control and proper lease classification. Companies must also consider tax implications and disclosure requirements.

#### Disclosure Requirements

Entities must disclose the nature of sale and leaseback transactions, including significant judgments made in determining whether a sale has occurred and the classification of the leaseback.

### Challenges and Common Pitfalls

1. **Misclassification of Lease**: Incorrectly classifying a lease can lead to significant financial statement misrepresentation.
2. **Transfer of Control**: Misjudging the transfer of control can result in improper sale recognition.
3. **Complex Lease Terms**: Complex leaseback terms can complicate the classification and measurement process.

### Best Practices

- **Thorough Analysis**: Conduct a detailed analysis of the sale and leaseback terms to ensure compliance with accounting standards.
- **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation of judgments and assumptions used in accounting for the transaction.
- **Regular Review**: Periodically review lease agreements and financial statements to ensure ongoing compliance.

### Conclusion

Sale and leaseback transactions offer significant benefits but require careful accounting to ensure compliance with Canadian standards. By understanding the intricacies of sale recognition, lease classification, and measurement, accountants can accurately report these transactions and provide valuable insights into a company's financial health.
