## 4.1 Common Stock

Common stock represents ownership in a corporation and is a fundamental component of shareholders' equity. Understanding the accounting for common stock is crucial for both financial reporting and decision-making. This section covers the key aspects of common stock, including its issuance, repurchase, and retirement, with a focus on par value and no-par value stock. We will explore the accounting procedures, relevant standards, and practical examples to provide a comprehensive understanding of common stock accounting.

### Understanding Common Stock

Common stock is a type of equity security that represents ownership in a corporation. Holders of common stock have voting rights, typically one vote per share, and may receive dividends. Common stockholders are residual claimants, meaning they have a claim on the company's assets after all liabilities and preferred stock claims have been satisfied.

#### Key Characteristics

- **Voting Rights:** Common stockholders typically have the right to vote on corporate matters, such as electing the board of directors.
- **Dividends:** Dividends on common stock are not guaranteed and are paid at the discretion of the board of directors.
- **Residual Claim:** In the event of liquidation, common stockholders have a claim on the remaining assets after all debts and preferred stock obligations have been settled.
- **Market Value:** The market value of common stock fluctuates based on the company's performance and market conditions.

### Par Value vs. No-Par Value Stock

Common stock can be issued with or without a par value, which affects how it is accounted for on the balance sheet.

#### Par Value Stock

Par value is a nominal value assigned to each share of stock and is often set at a minimal amount. It is an arbitrary value and does not reflect the market value of the stock. Par value serves as a legal capital requirement in some jurisdictions, ensuring that a minimum amount of capital is maintained in the company.

- **Accounting Treatment:** When par value stock is issued, the par value is recorded in the "Common Stock" account, and any amount received above par value is recorded in "Additional Paid-in Capital."

#### No-Par Value Stock

No-par value stock does not have a nominal value assigned to it. Instead, the entire proceeds from the issuance of no-par value stock are recorded in the "Common Stock" account.

- **Accounting Treatment:** The entire amount received from the issuance of no-par value stock is credited to the "Common Stock" account, simplifying the accounting process.

### Issuance of Common Stock

The issuance of common stock is a primary method for companies to raise capital. The accounting for stock issuance depends on whether the stock has a par value or is no-par value.

#### Issuance of Par Value Stock

When a company issues par value stock, the accounting entries reflect the par value and any additional paid-in capital.

**Example:**

A company issues 1,000 shares of $1 par value common stock for $10 per share.

- **Journal Entry:**

  ```
  Debit: Cash $10,000
  Credit: Common Stock $1,000
  Credit: Additional Paid-in Capital $9,000
  ```

#### Issuance of No-Par Value Stock

For no-par value stock, the entire proceeds are credited to the "Common Stock" account.

**Example:**

A company issues 1,000 shares of no-par value common stock for $10 per share.

- **Journal Entry:**

  ```
  Debit: Cash $10,000
  Credit: Common Stock $10,000
  ```

### Repurchase of Common Stock

Companies may repurchase their own stock for various reasons, such as to increase earnings per share, provide stock for employee compensation plans, or prevent hostile takeovers. Repurchased stock is often referred to as treasury stock.

#### Accounting for Treasury Stock

Treasury stock is recorded at cost and is a contra equity account, reducing total shareholders' equity.

**Example:**

A company repurchases 500 shares of its own stock at $12 per share.

- **Journal Entry:**

  ```
  Debit: Treasury Stock $6,000
  Credit: Cash $6,000
  ```

#### Impact on Financial Statements

- **Balance Sheet:** Treasury stock is deducted from total shareholders' equity.
- **Income Statement:** Repurchase of stock does not affect the income statement directly.

### Retirement of Common Stock

When a company retires common stock, the shares are permanently removed from circulation. This can affect the company's capital structure and financial ratios.

#### Accounting for Stock Retirement

The accounting for stock retirement involves removing the stock from the "Common Stock" and "Additional Paid-in Capital" accounts. Any difference between the cost of the repurchased stock and its par value is adjusted in the "Retained Earnings" account.

**Example:**

A company retires 500 shares of $1 par value stock that were repurchased at $12 per share.

- **Journal Entry:**

  ```
  Debit: Common Stock $500
  Debit: Additional Paid-in Capital $5,500
  Credit: Treasury Stock $6,000
  ```

### Regulatory Considerations

In Canada, the accounting for common stock is governed by the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the Canadian Accounting Standards Board (AcSB). Companies must adhere to these standards for accurate and transparent financial reporting.

#### Key IFRS Standards

- **IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments:** Provides guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments, including equity instruments.
- **IAS 32 - Financial Instruments: Presentation:** Addresses the presentation of financial instruments as liabilities or equity.
- **IAS 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements:** Outlines the requirements for presenting financial statements, including equity disclosures.

### Practical Examples and Case Studies

To further illustrate the concepts discussed, let's explore a practical example and a case study relevant to the Canadian accounting profession.

#### Practical Example: Issuing Stock for Non-Cash Consideration

A company issues 1,000 shares of $1 par value common stock in exchange for a piece of equipment valued at $15,000.

- **Journal Entry:**

  ```
  Debit: Equipment $15,000
  Credit: Common Stock $1,000
  Credit: Additional Paid-in Capital $14,000
  ```

#### Case Study: Impact of Stock Repurchase on Earnings Per Share

Consider a company with 10,000 outstanding shares and net income of $100,000. The company repurchases 1,000 shares at $15 per share.

- **Before Repurchase:**

  - Earnings Per Share (EPS) = $100,000 / 10,000 = $10

- **After Repurchase:**

  - New Outstanding Shares = 9,000
  - EPS = $100,000 / 9,000 = $11.11

The stock repurchase increases the EPS, which may positively influence the company's stock price.

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

#### Best Practices

- **Accurate Record-Keeping:** Ensure all stock transactions are accurately recorded and reported.
- **Compliance with Standards:** Adhere to IFRS and Canadian accounting standards for transparency and consistency.
- **Strategic Repurchase Decisions:** Consider the long-term impact of stock repurchases on the company's financial health.

#### Common Pitfalls

- **Overvaluation of Repurchased Stock:** Avoid overpaying for stock repurchases, which can deplete cash reserves.
- **Inadequate Disclosure:** Ensure all stock transactions and their impact on financial statements are adequately disclosed.

### Exam Preparation Tips

- **Understand Key Concepts:** Focus on the differences between par value and no-par value stock and their accounting treatments.
- **Practice Journal Entries:** Work through examples of stock issuance, repurchase, and retirement to reinforce your understanding.
- **Review IFRS Standards:** Familiarize yourself with the relevant IFRS standards and their application to common stock accounting.
