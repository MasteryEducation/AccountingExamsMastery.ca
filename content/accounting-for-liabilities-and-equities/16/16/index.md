- Total Liabilities: CAD 4,000,000
- Shareholders' Equity: CAD 6,000,000
- Current Debt-to-Equity Ratio: 0.67

**Objective:**

Analyze the impact of each financing option on the company's financial position and ratios, and recommend the most suitable option.

**Analysis:**

1. **Issuing Long-term Debt:**

   - **Impact on Financial Statements:**
     - Increase in liabilities, leading to a higher debt-to-equity ratio.
     - Interest expense will affect net income and cash flows.

     - Interest Coverage Ratio: Decreases, indicating a higher risk of default.
