## 16.4 Liquidity and Solvency Measures

In the realm of financial statement analysis, liquidity and solvency measures are pivotal in evaluating a company's financial health. These metrics provide insights into a company's ability to meet its short-term and long-term obligations, which is crucial for stakeholders, including investors, creditors, and management. Understanding these measures is essential for anyone preparing for Canadian accounting exams, as they form the backbone of financial analysis and decision-making.

### Understanding Liquidity

Liquidity refers to a company's ability to convert its assets into cash to meet its short-term liabilities. It is a measure of the ease with which a company can pay off its immediate obligations without raising external capital. Liquidity is vital for maintaining operational stability and avoiding financial distress.

#### Key Liquidity Ratios

1. **Current Ratio**

   The current ratio is a fundamental liquidity measure that compares a company's current assets to its current liabilities. It indicates the company's ability to cover its short-term obligations with its short-term assets.

   **Formula:**

   {{< katex >}}
   \text{Current Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}
   {{< /katex >}}

   **Example:**

   Consider a company with current assets of $500,000 and current liabilities of $250,000. The current ratio would be:

   {{< katex >}}
   \text{Current Ratio} = \frac{500,000}{250,000} = 2.0
   {{< /katex >}}

   A current ratio of 2.0 suggests that the company has twice as many current assets as it has current liabilities, indicating good liquidity.

2. **Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)**

   The quick ratio refines the current ratio by excluding inventory from current assets. It provides a more stringent assessment of liquidity by focusing on the most liquid assets.

   **Formula:**

   {{< katex >}}
   \text{Quick Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets} - \text{Inventory}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}
   {{< /katex >}}

   **Example:**

   If the company has $100,000 in inventory, the quick ratio would be:

   {{< katex >}}
   \text{Quick Ratio} = \frac{500,000 - 100,000}{250,000} = 1.6
   {{< /katex >}}

   A quick ratio of 1.6 indicates that the company can cover its current liabilities without relying on inventory sales.

3. **Cash Ratio**

   The cash ratio is the most conservative liquidity measure, considering only cash and cash equivalents against current liabilities.

   **Formula:**

   {{< katex >}}
   \text{Cash Ratio} = \frac{\text{Cash and Cash Equivalents}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}
   {{< /katex >}}

   **Example:**

   With cash and cash equivalents of $150,000, the cash ratio would be:

   {{< katex >}}
   \text{Cash Ratio} = \frac{150,000}{250,000} = 0.6
   {{< /katex >}}

   A cash ratio of 0.6 suggests that the company has 60% of its current liabilities covered by cash alone.

### Understanding Solvency

Solvency measures a company's ability to meet its long-term obligations and sustain operations over the long term. It reflects the company's financial leverage and its capacity to service debt.

#### Key Solvency Ratios

1. **Debt to Equity Ratio**

   The debt to equity ratio compares a company's total liabilities to its shareholders' equity, indicating the proportion of debt used to finance the company's assets.

   **Formula:**

   {{< katex >}}
   \text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Liabilities}}{\text{Shareholders' Equity}}
   {{< /katex >}}

   **Example:**

   If a company has total liabilities of $300,000 and shareholders' equity of $200,000, the debt to equity ratio would be:

   {{< katex >}}
   \text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \frac{300,000}{200,000} = 1.5
   {{< /katex >}}

   A ratio of 1.5 implies that the company uses $1.50 in debt for every dollar of equity, indicating moderate leverage.

2. **Interest Coverage Ratio**

   The interest coverage ratio assesses a company's ability to pay interest on its outstanding debt, using earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT).

   **Formula:**

   {{< katex >}}
   \text{Interest Coverage Ratio} = \frac{\text{EBIT}}{\text{Interest Expense}}
   {{< /katex >}}

   **Example:**

   With an EBIT of $100,000 and interest expenses of $20,000, the interest coverage ratio would be:

   {{< katex >}}
   \text{Interest Coverage Ratio} = \frac{100,000}{20,000} = 5.0
   {{< /katex >}}

   A ratio of 5.0 suggests that the company earns five times its interest obligations, indicating strong solvency.

3. **Equity Ratio**

   The equity ratio measures the proportion of total assets financed by shareholders' equity, reflecting the company's financial stability.

   **Formula:**

   {{< katex >}}
   \text{Equity Ratio} = \frac{\text{Shareholders' Equity}}{\text{Total Assets}}
   {{< /katex >}}

   **Example:**

   If the company has total assets of $600,000, the equity ratio would be:

   {{< katex >}}
   \text{Equity Ratio} = \frac{200,000}{600,000} = 0.33
   {{< /katex >}}

   An equity ratio of 0.33 indicates that 33% of the company's assets are financed by equity, suggesting a balanced capital structure.

### Practical Examples and Case Studies

#### Case Study: Analyzing Liquidity and Solvency

Consider a Canadian manufacturing company, MapleTech Inc., which has the following financial data:

- Current Assets: $800,000
- Inventory: $200,000
- Current Liabilities: $400,000
- Total Liabilities: $1,200,000
- Shareholders' Equity: $800,000
- EBIT: $150,000
- Interest Expense: $30,000

**Liquidity Analysis:**

- **Current Ratio:**

  {{< katex >}}
  \text{Current Ratio} = \frac{800,000}{400,000} = 2.0
  {{< /katex >}}

  MapleTech Inc. has a healthy current ratio, indicating good liquidity.

- **Quick Ratio:**

  {{< katex >}}
  \text{Quick Ratio} = \frac{800,000 - 200,000}{400,000} = 1.5
  {{< /katex >}}

  The quick ratio suggests that the company can meet its short-term obligations without relying on inventory sales.

- **Cash Ratio:**

  Assuming cash and cash equivalents of $300,000:

  {{< katex >}}
  \text{Cash Ratio} = \frac{300,000}{400,000} = 0.75
  {{< /katex >}}

  The cash ratio indicates that MapleTech Inc. has 75% of its current liabilities covered by cash.

**Solvency Analysis:**

- **Debt to Equity Ratio:**

  {{< katex >}}
  \text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \frac{1,200,000}{800,000} = 1.5
  {{< /katex >}}

  The company uses $1.50 in debt for every dollar of equity, reflecting moderate leverage.

- **Interest Coverage Ratio:**

  {{< katex >}}
  \text{Interest Coverage Ratio} = \frac{150,000}{30,000} = 5.0
  {{< /katex >}}

  The interest coverage ratio indicates strong solvency, with earnings covering interest expenses five times over.

- **Equity Ratio:**

  {{< katex >}}
  \text{Equity Ratio} = \frac{800,000}{2,000,000} = 0.4
  {{< /katex >}}

  The equity ratio shows that 40% of MapleTech Inc.'s assets are financed by equity, suggesting financial stability.
