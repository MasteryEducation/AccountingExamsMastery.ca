## 16.6 Trends and Common-size Analysis

### Introduction

In the realm of financial statement analysis, understanding the nuances of trends and common-size analysis is crucial for interpreting the financial health and operational efficiency of a business. These analytical tools provide insights into how a company’s financial position and performance have evolved over time and how they compare to industry standards. This section will delve into the methodologies of horizontal (trend) analysis and vertical (common-size) analysis, focusing on their application to liabilities and equities.

### Horizontal Analysis (Trend Analysis)

Horizontal analysis, also known as trend analysis, involves comparing financial data over a series of periods. This method highlights changes in financial statement items, enabling analysts to identify trends, growth patterns, and potential red flags in a company’s financial performance.

#### Key Concepts in Horizontal Analysis

- **Base Year Selection**: The first step in horizontal analysis is selecting a base year. The financial figures of subsequent years are compared against this base year to calculate percentage changes.
  
- **Percentage Change Calculation**: The formula for calculating the percentage change is:
  
  {{< katex >}}
  \text{Percentage Change} = \left(\frac{\text{Current Year Value} - \text{Base Year Value}}{\text{Base Year Value}}\right) \times 100
  {{< /katex >}}

- **Trend Identification**: By evaluating the percentage changes across multiple periods, analysts can identify trends such as consistent growth, decline, or volatility in financial metrics.

#### Application to Liabilities and Equities

Horizontal analysis can be particularly insightful when applied to liabilities and equities, as it helps in understanding how a company’s financial obligations and ownership structure evolve over time.

- **Liabilities**: Analyzing trends in liabilities can reveal changes in a company’s debt levels, which may indicate shifts in financial strategy or operational challenges. For example, a consistent increase in long-term debt may suggest expansion efforts, while a sudden spike could indicate financial distress.

- **Equities**: For equities, trend analysis can highlight changes in shareholder equity, retained earnings, and other equity components. A growing equity base might indicate profitability and retained earnings, while a declining trend could signal losses or dividend payouts.

#### Practical Example

Consider a company with the following liabilities over three years:

| Year | Current Liabilities | Long-term Liabilities |
|------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| 2021 | $100,000            | $200,000              |
| 2022 | $120,000            | $220,000              |
| 2023 | $140,000            | $250,000              |

To perform horizontal analysis, we calculate the percentage change from the base year (2021):

- **2022 Current Liabilities**: \\(\left(\frac{120,000 - 100,000}{100,000}\right) \times 100 = 20\%\\)
- **2023 Current Liabilities**: \\(\left(\frac{140,000 - 100,000}{100,000}\right) \times 100 = 40\%\\)

This analysis reveals a consistent increase in current liabilities, which may warrant further investigation into the causes, such as increased operational expenses or short-term borrowing.

### Vertical Analysis (Common-size Analysis)

Vertical analysis, or common-size analysis, involves expressing each item in a financial statement as a percentage of a base figure. This method facilitates comparison across companies of different sizes and within the same company over different periods.

#### Key Concepts in Vertical Analysis

- **Base Figure Selection**: In the income statement, sales or revenue is typically used as the base figure, while in the balance sheet, total assets or total liabilities and equity serve as the base.

- **Common-size Percentage Calculation**: The formula for calculating the common-size percentage is:

  {{< katex >}}
  \text{Common-size Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Item Value}}{\text{Base Figure}}\right) \times 100
  {{< /katex >}}

- **Comparative Analysis**: By converting financial statement items into percentages, vertical analysis allows for easy comparison across different periods and with industry benchmarks.

#### Application to Liabilities and Equities

Vertical analysis provides insights into the composition of liabilities and equities, helping analysts understand the relative weight of different financial components.

- **Liabilities**: By expressing liabilities as a percentage of total assets, analysts can assess the company’s leverage and risk profile. A high percentage of liabilities may indicate higher financial risk.

- **Equities**: Analyzing equities as a percentage of total assets helps in understanding the company’s capital structure and financial stability. A higher equity percentage typically signifies a stronger financial position.

#### Practical Example

Consider a company’s balance sheet with the following figures:

| Item                  | 2023 Value | Common-size Percentage (Base: Total Assets $500,000) |
|-----------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Current Liabilities   | $100,000   | \\(\left(\frac{100,000}{500,000}\right) \times 100 = 20\%\\) |
| Long-term Liabilities | $150,000   | \\(\left(\frac{150,000}{500,000}\right) \times 100 = 30\%\\) |
| Shareholders' Equity  | $250,000   | \\(\left(\frac{250,000}{500,000}\right) \times 100 = 50\%\\) |

This analysis shows that 50% of the company’s assets are financed by equity, while 50% are financed by liabilities, indicating a balanced capital structure.

### Combining Horizontal and Vertical Analysis

While horizontal and vertical analyses are powerful individually, combining them provides a more comprehensive view of a company’s financial health. Horizontal analysis reveals trends over time, while vertical analysis offers insights into the relative size of financial components.

#### Case Study: ABC Corporation

Let’s consider ABC Corporation, which has shown the following financial data over three years:

**Balance Sheet (in $000s)**

| Year | Total Assets | Current Liabilities | Long-term Liabilities | Shareholders' Equity |
|------|--------------|---------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| 2021 | 1,000        | 200                 | 300                   | 500                  |
| 2022 | 1,200        | 250                 | 350                   | 600                  |
| 2023 | 1,500        | 300                 | 400                   | 800                  |

**Horizontal Analysis (Percentage Change from 2021)**

- **2022 Total Assets**: \\(\left(\frac{1,200 - 1,000}{1,000}\right) \times 100 = 20\%\\)
- **2023 Total Assets**: \\(\left(\frac{1,500 - 1,000}{1,000}\right) \times 100 = 50\%\\)

**Vertical Analysis (2023 Common-size Analysis with Base: Total Assets $1,500,000)**

- **Current Liabilities**: \\(\left(\frac{300}{1,500}\right) \times 100 = 20\%\\)
- **Long-term Liabilities**: \\(\left(\frac{400}{1,500}\right) \times 100 = 26.67\%\\)
- **Shareholders' Equity**: \\(\left(\frac{800}{1,500}\right) \times 100 = 53.33\%\\)

**Interpretation**

The horizontal analysis shows a significant increase in total assets over the three-year period, indicating growth. The vertical analysis reveals that the company maintains a strong equity position, with over half of its assets financed by equity. This combination of analyses suggests that ABC Corporation is expanding while maintaining a stable financial structure.

### Real-world Applications and Regulatory Considerations

In practice, trend and common-size analyses are essential tools for financial analysts, investors, and regulatory bodies. These analyses help in:

- **Investment Decisions**: Investors use these analyses to assess the financial health and growth potential of companies, aiding in investment decisions.

- **Credit Analysis**: Creditors evaluate trends in liabilities to determine a company’s creditworthiness and risk profile.

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Regulatory bodies may require companies to perform these analyses to ensure transparency and compliance with financial reporting standards.

#### Canadian Accounting Standards

In Canada, financial statement analysis must align with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted in Canada and the Accounting Standards for Private Enterprises (ASPE). These standards provide guidelines on the presentation and disclosure of financial information, ensuring consistency and comparability.

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

When performing trends and common-size analyses, consider the following best practices and avoid common pitfalls:

#### Best Practices

- **Consistent Base Year**: Ensure consistency in the base year selection for horizontal analysis to maintain comparability.
