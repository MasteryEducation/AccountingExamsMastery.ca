## 9.13 Financial Liabilities at Amortized Cost

In the realm of financial accounting, understanding how to measure and report financial liabilities is crucial for accurate financial reporting and analysis. This section delves into the concept of financial liabilities at amortized cost, with a particular focus on the effective interest method, a cornerstone of financial accounting practices. This method is essential for Canadian accounting exams and professional practice, as it aligns with both International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Accounting Standards for Private Enterprises (ASPE) in Canada.

### **Understanding Financial Liabilities at Amortized Cost**

Financial liabilities at amortized cost are those that are not classified as held-for-trading or designated at fair value through profit or loss. They are typically measured using the amortized cost method, which involves recognizing interest expense over the period of the liability using the effective interest rate.

#### **Key Concepts and Terminology**

- **Amortized Cost:** The amount at which a financial liability is measured at initial recognition minus principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortization using the effective interest method of any difference between the initial amount and the maturity amount, and minus any reduction for impairment or uncollectibility.

- **Effective Interest Rate (EIR):** The rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability to the net carrying amount of the financial liability. It reflects the time value of money and the risk associated with the liability.

- **Initial Recognition:** Financial liabilities are initially recognized at fair value, typically the transaction price, adjusted for transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial liability.

### **The Effective Interest Method**

The effective interest method is a technique used to calculate the amortized cost of a financial liability and allocate the interest expense over the relevant period. This method ensures that the interest expense is recognized at a constant rate on the carrying amount of the liability.

#### **Calculation of the Effective Interest Rate**

The effective interest rate is calculated by considering the cash flows of the financial liability, including all fees and points paid or received, transaction costs, and any other premiums or discounts. The formula used is:

{{< katex >}} \text{EIR} = \frac{\text{Cash Flows}}{\text{Net Carrying Amount}} {{< /katex >}}

This calculation involves solving for the rate that equates the present value of the cash flows to the initial carrying amount of the liability.

#### **Application of the Effective Interest Method**

1. **Determine the Cash Flows:** Identify all cash flows associated with the financial liability, including interest payments and principal repayments.

2. **Calculate the Effective Interest Rate:** Use the EIR formula to determine the rate that discounts the cash flows to the initial carrying amount.

3. **Amortize the Liability:** Apply the effective interest rate to the carrying amount of the liability at the beginning of each period to determine the interest expense. Adjust the carrying amount by the difference between the interest expense and the cash interest paid.

4. **Adjust for Changes:** If there are changes in the expected cash flows, recalculate the effective interest rate and adjust the carrying amount accordingly.

### **Practical Example**

Consider a company that issues a bond with a face value of $100,000, a coupon rate of 5%, and a maturity of 5 years. The bond is issued at a discount, with an initial carrying amount of $95,000. The effective interest rate is calculated to be 6%.

#### **Yearly Amortization Schedule**

| Year | Beginning Balance | Interest Expense (6%) | Coupon Payment (5%) | Ending Balance |
|------|-------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| 1    | $95,000           | $5,700                | $5,000              | $95,700        |
| 2    | $95,700           | $5,742                | $5,000              | $96,442        |
| 3    | $96,442           | $5,786                | $5,000              | $97,228        |
| 4    | $97,228           | $5,834                | $5,000              | $98,062        |
| 5    | $98,062           | $5,884                | $5,000              | $98,946        |

In this example, the interest expense is calculated using the effective interest rate of 6%, and the coupon payment is based on the nominal rate of 5%. The difference between the interest expense and the coupon payment is added to the carrying amount of the liability.

### **Regulatory Framework and Compliance**

In Canada, the measurement of financial liabilities at amortized cost is governed by IFRS 9, Financial Instruments, and ASPE Section 3856, Financial Instruments. Both standards emphasize the use of the effective interest method for amortizing financial liabilities.

#### **IFRS 9 and ASPE Section 3856**

- **IFRS 9:** Requires entities to measure financial liabilities at amortized cost unless they are designated at fair value through profit or loss. The effective interest method is used to calculate interest expense.

- **ASPE Section 3856:** Similar to IFRS 9, it requires the use of the effective interest method for financial liabilities measured at amortized cost.

### **Common Pitfalls and Challenges**

1. **Incorrect Calculation of EIR:** Miscalculating the effective interest rate can lead to incorrect interest expense recognition and financial statement misrepresentation.

2. **Ignoring Transaction Costs:** Failing to include transaction costs in the initial measurement can result in an inaccurate carrying amount.

3. **Changes in Cash Flows:** Not adjusting for changes in expected cash flows can lead to discrepancies in the amortization schedule.

4. **Complex Financial Instruments:** Instruments with embedded derivatives or variable interest rates can complicate the calculation and application of the effective interest method.

### **Best Practices and Strategies**

- **Thorough Analysis:** Conduct a detailed analysis of all cash flows associated with the financial liability to ensure accurate EIR calculation.

- **Regular Reassessment:** Periodically reassess the expected cash flows and adjust the effective interest rate and carrying amount as necessary.

- **Documentation:** Maintain comprehensive documentation of the assumptions and calculations used in determining the effective interest rate.

- **Use of Technology:** Leverage accounting software to automate the calculation and application of the effective interest method, reducing the risk of human error.

### **Real-World Applications**

In practice, the effective interest method is widely used in the banking and financial services industry, where accurate interest expense recognition is critical for financial reporting and regulatory compliance. Companies issuing bonds, notes, or other debt instruments must apply this method to ensure compliance with accounting standards and provide transparent financial information to stakeholders.

### **Case Study: Canadian Corporation**

A Canadian corporation issues a 10-year bond with a face value of $1,000,000 at a discount, receiving $950,000 in proceeds. The bond has a coupon rate of 4%, and the effective interest rate is calculated to be 5%.

#### **Amortization Schedule for the First Three Years**

| Year | Beginning Balance | Interest Expense (5%) | Coupon Payment (4%) | Ending Balance |
|------|-------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| 1    | $950,000          | $47,500               | $40,000             | $957,500       |
| 2    | $957,500          | $47,875               | $40,000             | $965,375       |
| 3    | $965,375          | $48,269               | $40,000             | $973,644       |

In this case study, the corporation must recognize the interest expense using the effective interest rate of 5%, which is higher than the coupon rate of 4%. The difference between the interest expense and the coupon payment is added to the carrying amount of the bond, reflecting the amortization of the discount.

### **Exam Preparation Tips**

- **Understand the Concepts:** Focus on understanding the underlying principles of the effective interest method and its application to financial liabilities.
