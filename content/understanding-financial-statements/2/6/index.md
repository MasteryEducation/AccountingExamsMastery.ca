## 2.6 Non-Current Assets

Non-current assets, also known as fixed assets or long-term assets, are crucial components of a company's balance sheet. They represent resources that a company expects to hold for more than one year and are not intended for immediate sale. Understanding non-current assets is essential for evaluating a company's long-term financial health and operational capacity. In this section, we will delve into the various types of non-current assets, including property, plant, and equipment (PPE), intangible assets, and long-term investments. We will also explore how these assets are accounted for, valued, and reported in financial statements, particularly in the context of Canadian accounting standards.

### **1. Introduction to Non-Current Assets**

Non-current assets are vital for a company's operations and growth. They provide the infrastructure and resources necessary for producing goods and services. Unlike current assets, which are expected to be converted into cash within a year, non-current assets are held for long-term use. They are typically categorized into three main types:

1. **Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE):** Tangible assets used in production or supply of goods and services.
2. **Intangible Assets:** Non-physical assets that provide future economic benefits, such as patents and trademarks.
3. **Long-Term Investments:** Investments in other companies or financial instruments intended to be held for an extended period.

### **2. Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE)**

#### **2.1 Definition and Characteristics**

Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE) are tangible assets that a company uses in its operations to generate revenue. These assets have a useful life extending beyond one year and are subject to depreciation. Examples include buildings, machinery, vehicles, and furniture.

**Key Characteristics of PPE:**
- **Tangible Nature:** Physical presence that can be seen and touched.
- **Long-Term Use:** Intended for use over multiple accounting periods.
- **Depreciation:** Systematic allocation of the asset's cost over its useful life.

#### **2.2 Accounting for PPE**

Accounting for PPE involves several key steps, including initial recognition, measurement, and subsequent depreciation.

**Initial Recognition:**
- PPE is initially recorded at cost, which includes the purchase price and any directly attributable costs necessary to bring the asset to its intended use.

**Measurement:**
- After initial recognition, PPE can be measured using either the cost model or the revaluation model.
  - **Cost Model:** PPE is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
  - **Revaluation Model:** PPE is carried at a revalued amount, being its fair value at the date of revaluation less subsequent depreciation and impairment losses.

**Depreciation:**
- Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life. Common methods include the straight-line method, declining balance method, and units of production method.

**Example:**
Consider a company that purchases machinery for $100,000 with an expected useful life of 10 years and a residual value of $10,000. Using the straight-line method, the annual depreciation expense would be:

{{< katex >}} \text{Depreciation Expense} = \frac{\text{Cost} - \text{Residual Value}}{\text{Useful Life}} = \frac{100,000 - 10,000}{10} = 9,000 {{< /katex >}}

#### **2.3 Impairment of PPE**

Impairment occurs when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. Companies must assess PPE for impairment at each reporting date and recognize an impairment loss if necessary.

**Steps for Impairment Testing:**
1. **Identify Indicators of Impairment:** Changes in market conditions, legal factors, or physical damage.
2. **Calculate Recoverable Amount:** The higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
3. **Recognize Impairment Loss:** If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, recognize an impairment loss in the income statement.

### **3. Intangible Assets**

#### **3.1 Definition and Types**

Intangible assets are non-physical assets that provide future economic benefits. They are identifiable and controlled by the company as a result of past events. Common types include patents, trademarks, copyrights, and goodwill.

**Key Characteristics of Intangible Assets:**
- **Non-Physical Nature:** Cannot be seen or touched.
- **Identifiability:** Can be separated from the entity and sold, transferred, or licensed.
- **Control:** The company has the power to obtain future economic benefits from the asset.

#### **3.2 Accounting for Intangible Assets**

**Initial Recognition:**
- Intangible assets are initially recognized at cost if it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity and the cost can be measured reliably.

**Amortization:**
- Similar to depreciation for tangible assets, amortization is the systematic allocation of the cost of an intangible asset over its useful life. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but tested for impairment annually.

**Example:**
A company acquires a patent for $50,000 with a useful life of 10 years. The annual amortization expense using the straight-line method would be:

{{< katex >}} \text{Amortization Expense} = \frac{\text{Cost}}{\text{Useful Life}} = \frac{50,000}{10} = 5,000 {{< /katex >}}

#### **3.3 Impairment of Intangible Assets**

Intangible assets are subject to impairment testing. For assets with indefinite useful lives, impairment testing is conducted annually. For other intangible assets, impairment testing is required only when there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.

### **4. Long-Term Investments**

#### **4.1 Definition and Types**

Long-term investments are financial assets that a company intends to hold for more than one year. They can include investments in stocks, bonds, real estate, or other companies.

**Types of Long-Term Investments:**
- **Equity Investments:** Ownership interest in another company, such as stocks.
- **Debt Investments:** Investments in bonds or other debt securities.
- **Real Estate Investments:** Properties held for investment purposes.

#### **4.2 Accounting for Long-Term Investments**

**Initial Recognition:**
- Long-term investments are initially recognized at cost, which includes the purchase price and any directly attributable transaction costs.

**Subsequent Measurement:**
- Long-term investments can be measured using different methods depending on the type of investment and the company's accounting policy.
  - **Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL):** Investments are measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss.
  - **Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI):** Investments are measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income.
  - **Amortized Cost:** Used for debt investments that the company intends to hold to maturity.

**Example:**
A company invests $100,000 in bonds with a 5% annual interest rate. If the bonds are classified as FVOCI, any changes in the fair value of the bonds will be recognized in other comprehensive income.

### **5. Real-World Applications and Regulatory Scenarios**

#### **5.1 Canadian Accounting Standards**

In Canada, non-current assets are accounted for in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the Canadian Accounting Standards Board (AcSB). Key standards include:

- **IAS 16 - Property, Plant, and Equipment:** Provides guidance on the recognition, measurement, and depreciation of PPE.
- **IAS 38 - Intangible Assets:** Outlines the accounting treatment for intangible assets, including recognition, measurement, and amortization.
- **IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments:** Covers the classification and measurement of financial assets, including long-term investments.

#### **5.2 Compliance Considerations**

Companies must ensure compliance with relevant accounting standards and regulations when accounting for non-current assets. This includes maintaining accurate records, conducting regular impairment testing, and providing adequate disclosures in financial statements.

### **6. Best Practices and Common Pitfalls**

#### **6.1 Best Practices**

- **Regular Asset Reviews:** Conduct regular reviews of non-current assets to ensure accurate valuation and identify any impairment indicators.
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Maintain detailed records of asset acquisitions, disposals, and depreciation calculations.
- **Consistent Policies:** Apply consistent accounting policies for asset recognition, measurement, and depreciation to ensure comparability over time.

#### **6.2 Common Pitfalls**

- **Overlooking Impairment Indicators:** Failing to identify and address impairment indicators can lead to overstated asset values.
- **Inconsistent Depreciation Methods:** Using inconsistent depreciation methods can result in inaccurate financial reporting.
- **Inadequate Disclosures:** Insufficient disclosures about non-current assets can lead to non-compliance with accounting standards.

### **7. Practical Examples and Case Studies**

#### **7.1 Case Study: Accounting for PPE**

Consider a manufacturing company that purchases a new production line for $500,000. The company estimates the useful life of the production line to be 15 years with a residual value of $50,000. Using the straight-line method, the annual depreciation expense would be:

{{< katex >}} \text{Depreciation Expense} = \frac{500,000 - 50,000}{15} = 30,000 {{< /katex >}}

After five years, the company conducts an impairment test and determines that the recoverable amount of the production line is $350,000. The carrying amount at that time is $350,000 ($500,000 - $150,000 in accumulated depreciation). Since the carrying amount equals the recoverable amount, no impairment loss is recognized.

#### **7.2 Case Study: Intangible Asset Impairment**

A technology company acquires a software license for $200,000 with an indefinite useful life. The company conducts an annual impairment test and determines that the recoverable amount of the software is $180,000. Since the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, an impairment loss of $20,000 is recognized in the income statement.

### **8. Summary and Key Takeaways**

Non-current assets are essential for a company's long-term operations and financial stability. Understanding the accounting treatment for property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets, and long-term investments is crucial for accurate financial reporting and compliance with Canadian accounting standards. By following best practices and avoiding common pitfalls, companies can ensure that their non-current assets are accurately valued and reported.
