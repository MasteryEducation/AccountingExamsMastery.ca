## 13.2 Building Financial Models

Building financial models is a crucial skill for accountants and financial analysts, especially when preparing for Canadian accounting exams. A financial model is a tool that helps in making informed business decisions by simulating the financial performance of a company. It is built using historical data and assumptions about future performance to project financial outcomes. This section will guide you through the steps to create robust financial models, focusing on the Canadian context and exam requirements.

### Understanding the Purpose of Financial Models

Financial models serve several purposes, including:

- **Forecasting Future Performance:** By analyzing historical data and making assumptions, financial models help predict future financial performance.
- **Valuation:** Models are used to determine the value of a business or investment.
- **Decision-Making:** They assist in making strategic decisions such as mergers, acquisitions, and capital investments.
- **Risk Management:** Models help identify potential risks and develop mitigation strategies.

### Key Components of Financial Models

Before diving into the building process, it's essential to understand the key components of a financial model:

1. **Historical Financial Statements:** These include the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement. Historical data is the foundation of any financial model.
2. **Assumptions:** These are educated guesses about future performance, including revenue growth rates, cost structures, and market conditions.
3. **Forecasted Financial Statements:** These are projections of future financial performance based on historical data and assumptions.
4. **Valuation Outputs:** These include metrics like net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), and other financial ratios.
5. **Sensitivity Analysis:** This involves testing how changes in assumptions affect the model's outcomes.

### Steps to Build a Financial Model

#### Step 1: Define the Objective

The first step in building a financial model is to clearly define its objective. Are you valuing a company, forecasting future performance, or assessing a potential investment? The objective will guide the structure and complexity of the model.

#### Step 2: Gather Historical Data

Collect historical financial statements for at least three to five years. This data will serve as the basis for your model. Ensure the data is accurate and consistent, as any errors can lead to incorrect projections.

#### Step 3: Analyze Historical Performance

Analyze the historical data to identify trends and patterns. Look for consistent growth rates, seasonal variations, and any anomalies that may affect future performance. This analysis will help in making informed assumptions.

#### Step 4: Develop Assumptions

Based on your analysis, develop assumptions for future performance. These may include:

- **Revenue Growth Rates:** Consider historical growth, market trends, and competitive landscape.
- **Cost Structures:** Analyze fixed and variable costs, and consider potential changes in cost drivers.
- **Capital Expenditures:** Estimate future capital investments required for growth.
- **Working Capital Needs:** Assess changes in working capital requirements based on historical trends.

#### Step 5: Build the Model Structure

Create the structure of your model using spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel. The model should include separate sheets for:

- **Assumptions:** Clearly list all assumptions used in the model.
- **Income Statement:** Forecast revenue, expenses, and net income.
- **Balance Sheet:** Project assets, liabilities, and equity.
- **Cash Flow Statement:** Forecast cash inflows and outflows.

#### Step 6: Populate the Model with Historical Data

Input the historical financial data into the model. This will serve as the baseline for your projections. Ensure that the data is organized and formatted consistently.

#### Step 7: Forecast Financial Statements

Using the historical data and assumptions, forecast the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement. Ensure that the projections are realistic and aligned with the assumptions.

#### Step 8: Perform Sensitivity Analysis

Conduct sensitivity analysis to test the impact of changes in assumptions on the model's outcomes. This analysis helps identify key drivers of financial performance and assess potential risks.

#### Step 9: Validate the Model

Review the model for accuracy and consistency. Check for errors in formulas and ensure that the projections align with the assumptions. Validation is crucial to ensure the reliability of the model.

#### Step 10: Present the Model

Prepare a presentation of the model's findings, including key insights and recommendations. Use charts and graphs to visually represent the data and make the information more accessible.

### Practical Example: Building a Financial Model for a Retail Company

Let's walk through a practical example of building a financial model for a retail company.

#### Objective

The objective is to forecast the company's financial performance over the next five years to assess its valuation for a potential acquisition.

#### Historical Data

Gather historical financial statements for the past five years, including:

- **Income Statement:** Revenue, cost of goods sold (COGS), operating expenses, and net income.
- **Balance Sheet:** Assets, liabilities, and equity.
- **Cash Flow Statement:** Cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities.

#### Assumptions

Develop assumptions based on historical analysis and market research:

- **Revenue Growth:** Assume a 5% annual growth rate based on historical trends and market analysis.
- **COGS:** Assume COGS will remain at 60% of revenue.
- **Operating Expenses:** Assume a 3% annual increase in operating expenses.
- **Capital Expenditures:** Assume annual capital expenditures of $500,000 to support growth.
- **Working Capital:** Assume a 5% increase in working capital requirements annually.

#### Model Structure

Create the model structure in Excel with separate sheets for assumptions, income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement.

#### Populate Historical Data

Input the historical financial data into the model, ensuring consistency in formatting.

#### Forecast Financial Statements

Using the assumptions, forecast the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement for the next five years.

#### Sensitivity Analysis

Perform sensitivity analysis to test the impact of changes in revenue growth and operating expenses on the company's valuation.

#### Validate and Present

Validate the model for accuracy and present the findings, highlighting key insights and recommendations for the acquisition decision.

### Best Practices in Financial Modeling

- **Use Consistent Formatting:** Ensure consistent formatting throughout the model for clarity and ease of understanding.
- **Document Assumptions:** Clearly document all assumptions and rationale for transparency.
- **Regularly Update the Model:** Update the model with new data and assumptions to maintain its relevance.
- **Simplify Where Possible:** Avoid unnecessary complexity and focus on key drivers of financial performance.
- **Use Visuals:** Incorporate charts and graphs to enhance understanding and presentation.

### Common Pitfalls and Challenges

- **Overly Optimistic Assumptions:** Avoid making overly optimistic assumptions that may lead to unrealistic projections.
- **Ignoring External Factors:** Consider external factors such as economic conditions and industry trends that may impact the model.
- **Complexity Overload:** Avoid adding unnecessary complexity that may obscure key insights.
- **Lack of Validation:** Ensure thorough validation to avoid errors and inaccuracies in the model.

### Regulatory Considerations

When building financial models, it's essential to consider regulatory requirements and standards, including:

- **International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS):** Ensure compliance with IFRS as adopted in Canada.
- **Accounting Standards for Private Enterprises (ASPE):** Consider ASPE guidelines for private companies.
- **CPA Canada Guidelines:** Follow guidelines and best practices recommended by CPA Canada.
