## 7.4 Ratio Analysis Overview

Ratio analysis is a critical tool in financial statement analysis, allowing stakeholders to evaluate the relationships among various financial statement items. This technique provides insights into a company's operational efficiency, liquidity, profitability, and solvency, making it indispensable for accountants, investors, and financial analysts. In this section, we will delve into the fundamentals of ratio analysis, explore its applications, and provide practical examples to enhance your understanding.

### Understanding Ratio Analysis

Ratio analysis involves calculating and interpreting financial ratios from a company's financial statements. These ratios are used to assess various aspects of a company's performance and financial health. By comparing ratios over time or against industry benchmarks, stakeholders can identify trends, strengths, and weaknesses in a company's operations.

#### Types of Financial Ratios

Financial ratios are generally categorized into several types, each serving a specific purpose:

1. **Liquidity Ratios**: Measure a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations.
2. **Solvency Ratios**: Assess a company's long-term financial stability and debt-paying ability.
3. **Profitability Ratios**: Evaluate a company's ability to generate profit relative to its revenue, assets, or equity.
4. **Efficiency Ratios**: Indicate how effectively a company utilizes its assets and manages its operations.
5. **Market Value Ratios**: Provide insights into a company's market performance and investor perceptions.

### Liquidity Ratios

Liquidity ratios measure a company's capacity to cover its short-term liabilities with its short-term assets. These ratios are crucial for assessing a company's financial flexibility and operational efficiency.

#### Current Ratio

The current ratio is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities. It indicates whether a company has enough resources to pay its debts over the next 12 months.

**Formula:**

{{< katex >}} \text{Current Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{Current Liabilities}} {{< /katex >}}

**Example:**

If a company has current assets of $200,000 and current liabilities of $100,000, the current ratio would be:

{{< katex >}} \text{Current Ratio} = \frac{200,000}{100,000} = 2.0 {{< /katex >}}

A current ratio of 2.0 suggests that the company has twice as many current assets as current liabilities, indicating good short-term financial health.

#### Quick Ratio

Also known as the acid-test ratio, the quick ratio measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations without relying on the sale of inventory. It is more stringent than the current ratio.

**Formula:**

{{< katex >}} \text{Quick Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets} - \text{Inventory}}{\text{Current Liabilities}} {{< /katex >}}

**Example:**

With current assets of $200,000, inventory of $50,000, and current liabilities of $100,000, the quick ratio would be:

{{< katex >}} \text{Quick Ratio} = \frac{200,000 - 50,000}{100,000} = 1.5 {{< /katex >}}

A quick ratio of 1.5 indicates that the company can cover its current liabilities 1.5 times without selling inventory.

### Solvency Ratios

Solvency ratios assess a company's ability to meet its long-term obligations and its financial leverage.

#### Debt to Equity Ratio

The debt to equity ratio compares a company's total liabilities to its shareholder equity, indicating the proportion of financing that comes from creditors versus owners.

**Formula:**

{{< katex >}} \text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Liabilities}}{\text{Shareholder Equity}} {{< /katex >}}

**Example:**

If a company has total liabilities of $300,000 and shareholder equity of $600,000, the debt to equity ratio would be:

{{< katex >}} \text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \frac{300,000}{600,000} = 0.5 {{< /katex >}}

A ratio of 0.5 suggests that the company uses $0.50 of debt for every dollar of equity, indicating a conservative financial structure.

#### Interest Coverage Ratio

The interest coverage ratio measures a company's ability to pay interest on its outstanding debt with its earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT).

**Formula:**

{{< katex >}} \text{Interest Coverage Ratio} = \frac{\text{EBIT}}{\text{Interest Expense}} {{< /katex >}}

**Example:**

With an EBIT of $150,000 and an interest expense of $30,000, the interest coverage ratio would be:

{{< katex >}} \text{Interest Coverage Ratio} = \frac{150,000}{30,000} = 5.0 {{< /katex >}}

An interest coverage ratio of 5.0 indicates that the company can cover its interest expenses five times over, suggesting strong financial health.

### Profitability Ratios

Profitability ratios evaluate a company's ability to generate profit relative to its revenue, assets, or equity.

#### Gross Profit Margin

The gross profit margin measures the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS), reflecting the efficiency of production and pricing strategies.

**Formula:**

{{< katex >}} \text{Gross Profit Margin} = \left( \frac{\text{Revenue} - \text{COGS}}{\text{Revenue}} \right) \times 100 {{< /katex >}}

**Example:**

If a company has revenue of $500,000 and COGS of $300,000, the gross profit margin would be:

{{< katex >}} \text{Gross Profit Margin} = \left( \frac{500,000 - 300,000}{500,000} \right) \times 100 = 40\% {{< /katex >}}

A gross profit margin of 40% indicates that the company retains $0.40 from each dollar of sales after covering the cost of goods sold.

#### Return on Assets (ROA)

ROA measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate profit.

**Formula:**

{{< katex >}} \text{ROA} = \left( \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Total Assets}} \right) \times 100 {{< /katex >}}

**Example:**

With a net income of $80,000 and total assets of $1,000,000, the ROA would be:

{{< katex >}} \text{ROA} = \left( \frac{80,000}{1,000,000} \right) \times 100 = 8\% {{< /katex >}}

An ROA of 8% indicates that the company generates $0.08 in profit for every dollar of assets.

### Efficiency Ratios

Efficiency ratios indicate how effectively a company utilizes its assets and manages its operations.

#### Inventory Turnover Ratio

The inventory turnover ratio measures how quickly a company sells its inventory within a period.

**Formula:**

{{< katex >}} \text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \frac{\text{COGS}}{\text{Average Inventory}} {{< /katex >}}

**Example:**

With COGS of $300,000 and an average inventory of $50,000, the inventory turnover ratio would be:

{{< katex >}} \text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \frac{300,000}{50,000} = 6 {{< /katex >}}

An inventory turnover ratio of 6 suggests that the company sells and replaces its inventory six times a year.

#### Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio

This ratio measures how efficiently a company collects revenue from its credit sales.

**Formula:**

{{< katex >}} \text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \frac{\text{Net Credit Sales}}{\text{Average Accounts Receivable}} {{< /katex >}}

**Example:**

With net credit sales of $400,000 and average accounts receivable of $80,000, the accounts receivable turnover ratio would be:

{{< katex >}} \text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \frac{400,000}{80,000} = 5 {{< /katex >}}

A ratio of 5 indicates that the company collects its average receivables five times a year.

### Market Value Ratios

Market value ratios provide insights into a company's market performance and investor perceptions.

#### Price/Earnings (P/E) Ratio

The P/E ratio compares a company's current share price to its earnings per share (EPS), indicating how much investors are willing to pay per dollar of earnings.

**Formula:**

{{< katex >}} \text{P/E Ratio} = \frac{\text{Market Price per Share}}{\text{Earnings per Share}} {{< /katex >}}

**Example:**

If a company's market price per share is $50 and its EPS is $5, the P/E ratio would be:

{{< katex >}} \text{P/E Ratio} = \frac{50}{5} = 10 {{< /katex >}}

A P/E ratio of 10 suggests that investors are willing to pay $10 for every dollar of earnings.

#### Dividend Yield

The dividend yield measures the annual dividend income relative to the share price, indicating the return on investment from dividends.

**Formula:**

{{< katex >}} \text{Dividend Yield} = \left( \frac{\text{Annual Dividends per Share}}{\text{Market Price per Share}} \right) \times 100 {{< /katex >}}

**Example:**

If a company pays annual dividends of $2 per share and the market price per share is $40, the dividend yield would be:

{{< katex >}} \text{Dividend Yield} = \left( \frac{2}{40} \right) \times 100 = 5\% {{< /katex >}}

A dividend yield of 5% indicates that investors receive a 5% return on their investment from dividends alone.

### Practical Applications of Ratio Analysis

Ratio analysis is a versatile tool that can be applied in various scenarios to assess a company's financial health and performance. Here are some practical applications:

1. **Investment Decisions**: Investors use ratios to evaluate the attractiveness of potential investments and compare companies within the same industry.
