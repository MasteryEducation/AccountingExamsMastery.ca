3. **Sustainable Business Practices**: Ethical culture promotes sustainable business practices by encouraging responsible decision-making and long-term thinking.

4. **Employee Morale and Engagement**: A strong ethical culture enhances employee morale and engagement, leading to increased productivity and reduced turnover.

### Strategies for Promoting Ethical Culture
