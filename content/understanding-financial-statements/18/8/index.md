## 18.8 Case Studies and Practice Exercises

Understanding financial statements is crucial for anyone preparing for Canadian accounting exams. This section provides practical case studies and exercises to help you apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios. By working through these examples, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how financial statements reflect a company's financial health and how to interpret key financial indicators.

### Case Study 1: Analyzing a Balance Sheet

#### Background

ABC Manufacturing Inc. is a mid-sized company specializing in producing eco-friendly packaging materials. The company has been in operation for 10 years and is looking to expand its operations. Below is a simplified balance sheet for ABC Manufacturing Inc. as of December 31, 2023:

| **Assets**                | **Liabilities and Equity**     |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Current Assets**        | **Current Liabilities**        |
| Cash: $50,000             | Accounts Payable: $30,000      |
| Accounts Receivable: $70,000 | Short-term Debt: $20,000    |
| Inventory: $80,000        | **Non-Current Liabilities**    |
| **Non-Current Assets**    | Long-term Debt: $100,000       |
| Property, Plant, Equipment: $300,000 | **Equity**         |
| Intangible Assets: $20,000 | Common Stock: $200,000        |
|                           | Retained Earnings: $170,000    |

#### Exercise

1. **Calculate the Current Ratio**: This ratio measures the company's ability to pay short-term obligations with its short-term assets. Use the formula:

   {{< katex >}}
   \text{Current Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}
   {{< /katex >}}

2. **Determine the Debt-to-Equity Ratio**: This ratio indicates the relative proportion of shareholders' equity and debt used to finance the company's assets. Use the formula:

   {{< katex >}}
   \text{Debt-to-Equity Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Liabilities}}{\text{Equity}}
   {{< /katex >}}

3. **Analyze the Working Capital**: Calculate the working capital to assess the company's short-term financial health. Use the formula:

   {{< katex >}}
   \text{Working Capital} = \text{Current Assets} - \text{Current Liabilities}
   {{< /katex >}}

#### Solution

1. **Current Ratio**:

   {{< katex >}}
   \text{Current Ratio} = \frac{50,000 + 70,000 + 80,000}{30,000 + 20,000} = \frac{200,000}{50,000} = 4.0
   {{< /katex >}}

   A current ratio of 4.0 indicates that ABC Manufacturing Inc. has four times more current assets than current liabilities, suggesting strong liquidity.

2. **Debt-to-Equity Ratio**:

   {{< katex >}}
   \text{Debt-to-Equity Ratio} = \frac{30,000 + 20,000 + 100,000}{200,000 + 170,000} = \frac{150,000}{370,000} \approx 0.41
   {{< /katex >}}

   A debt-to-equity ratio of 0.41 indicates that the company uses less debt compared to equity, which is generally considered a conservative approach.

3. **Working Capital**:

   {{< katex >}}
   \text{Working Capital} = 200,000 - 50,000 = 150,000
   {{< /katex >}}

   Positive working capital of $150,000 suggests that the company can cover its short-term liabilities with its short-term assets.

### Case Study 2: Income Statement Analysis

#### Background

XYZ Retail Ltd. is a chain of retail stores selling consumer electronics. The company has experienced fluctuating sales over the past few years. Below is the income statement for the year ending December 31, 2023:

| **Revenue**               | $500,000  |
|---------------------------|-----------|
| **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)** | $300,000  |
| **Gross Profit**          | $200,000  |
| **Operating Expenses**    | $120,000  |
| **Operating Income**      | $80,000   |
| **Interest Expense**      | $10,000   |
| **Income Tax Expense**    | $15,000   |
| **Net Income**            | $55,000   |

#### Exercise

1. **Calculate the Gross Profit Margin**: This margin indicates how efficiently a company uses its resources to produce goods. Use the formula:

   {{< katex >}}
   \text{Gross Profit Margin} = \frac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Revenue}} \times 100
   {{< /katex >}}

2. **Determine the Operating Margin**: This margin shows the proportion of revenue left after covering operating expenses. Use the formula:

   {{< katex >}}
   \text{Operating Margin} = \frac{\text{Operating Income}}{\text{Revenue}} \times 100
   {{< /katex >}}

3. **Evaluate the Net Profit Margin**: This margin reflects the percentage of revenue that remains as profit after all expenses. Use the formula:

   {{< katex >}}
   \text{Net Profit Margin} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Revenue}} \times 100
   {{< /katex >}}

#### Solution

1. **Gross Profit Margin**:

   {{< katex >}}
   \text{Gross Profit Margin} = \frac{200,000}{500,000} \times 100 = 40\%
   {{< /katex >}}

   A gross profit margin of 40% indicates that XYZ Retail Ltd. retains 40% of its revenue after accounting for the cost of goods sold.

2. **Operating Margin**:

   {{< katex >}}
   \text{Operating Margin} = \frac{80,000}{500,000} \times 100 = 16\%
   {{< /katex >}}

   An operating margin of 16% suggests that the company retains 16% of its revenue after covering operating expenses.

3. **Net Profit Margin**:

   {{< katex >}}
   \text{Net Profit Margin} = \frac{55,000}{500,000} \times 100 = 11\%
   {{< /katex >}}

   A net profit margin of 11% indicates that XYZ Retail Ltd. retains 11% of its revenue as profit after all expenses.

### Case Study 3: Cash Flow Statement Interpretation

#### Background

LMN Services Corp. is a consulting firm providing business advisory services. The company has been focusing on improving its cash flow management. Below is the cash flow statement for the year ending December 31, 2023:

| **Cash Flows from Operating Activities** | $60,000  |
|------------------------------------------|----------|
| **Cash Flows from Investing Activities** | $(40,000) |
| **Cash Flows from Financing Activities** | $20,000  |
| **Net Increase in Cash**                 | $40,000  |
| **Beginning Cash Balance**               | $10,000  |
| **Ending Cash Balance**                  | $50,000  |

#### Exercise

1. **Analyze the Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: Determine whether the company is generating sufficient cash from its core operations.

2. **Evaluate the Cash Flow from Investing Activities**: Assess the company's investment in long-term assets and its impact on cash flow.

3. **Interpret the Cash Flow from Financing Activities**: Understand the company's financing strategy and its effect on cash flow.

#### Solution

1. **Cash Flow from Operating Activities**:

   The positive cash flow of $60,000 from operating activities indicates that LMN Services Corp. is generating sufficient cash from its core operations, which is a positive sign of operational efficiency.

2. **Cash Flow from Investing Activities**:

   The negative cash flow of $(40,000) from investing activities suggests that the company is investing in long-term assets, which could be a sign of growth and expansion. However, it also indicates cash outflow that needs to be managed.

3. **Cash Flow from Financing Activities**:

   The positive cash flow of $20,000 from financing activities indicates that the company is raising funds, possibly through debt or equity, to support its operations or investments.
