## 18.3 Financial Ratio Formulas

Financial ratios are vital tools for analyzing a company's financial health and performance. They provide insights into various aspects of a business, such as liquidity, profitability, efficiency, and solvency. This section will delve into the most critical financial ratios, their formulas, and how they can be applied in real-world scenarios, especially within the context of Canadian accounting standards and practices.

### **1. Liquidity Ratios**

Liquidity ratios measure a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations. They are crucial for assessing the financial stability of a business.

#### **1.1 Current Ratio**

**Formula:** 

{{< katex >}} \text{Current Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{Current Liabilities}} {{< /katex >}}

**Explanation:** This ratio indicates the company's ability to pay its short-term liabilities with its short-term assets. A higher ratio suggests better liquidity.

**Example:** If a company has current assets of $500,000 and current liabilities of $250,000, the current ratio is:

{{< katex >}} \frac{500,000}{250,000} = 2.0 {{< /katex >}}

#### **1.2 Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)**

**Formula:** 

{{< katex >}} \text{Quick Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets} - \text{Inventory}}{\text{Current Liabilities}} {{< /katex >}}

**Explanation:** This ratio is a more stringent test of liquidity, excluding inventory from current assets, as inventory may not be quickly converted to cash.

**Example:** With current assets of $500,000, inventory of $100,000, and current liabilities of $250,000, the quick ratio is:

{{< katex >}} \frac{500,000 - 100,000}{250,000} = 1.6 {{< /katex >}}

### **2. Solvency Ratios**

Solvency ratios assess a company's ability to meet its long-term obligations, providing insights into its financial leverage and risk.

#### **2.1 Debt to Equity Ratio**

**Formula:** 

{{< katex >}} \text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Liabilities}}{\text{Shareholders' Equity}} {{< /katex >}}

**Explanation:** This ratio measures the relative proportion of shareholders' equity and debt used to finance a company's assets. A lower ratio indicates less risk.

**Example:** If total liabilities are $300,000 and shareholders' equity is $600,000, the debt to equity ratio is:

{{< katex >}} \frac{300,000}{600,000} = 0.5 {{< /katex >}}

#### **2.2 Interest Coverage Ratio**

**Formula:** 

{{< katex >}} \text{Interest Coverage Ratio} = \frac{\text{EBIT}}{\text{Interest Expense}} {{< /katex >}}

**Explanation:** This ratio indicates how easily a company can pay interest on its outstanding debt. A higher ratio suggests better financial health.

**Example:** With an EBIT of $150,000 and interest expenses of $30,000, the interest coverage ratio is:

{{< katex >}} \frac{150,000}{30,000} = 5.0 {{< /katex >}}

### **3. Profitability Ratios**

Profitability ratios evaluate a company's ability to generate profit relative to its revenue, assets, equity, and other financial metrics.

#### **3.1 Gross Profit Margin**

**Formula:** 

{{< katex >}} \text{Gross Profit Margin} = \frac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Revenue}} \times 100 {{< /katex >}}

**Explanation:** This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS), indicating the efficiency of production and pricing.

**Example:** With a gross profit of $200,000 and revenue of $500,000, the gross profit margin is:

{{< katex >}} \frac{200,000}{500,000} \times 100 = 40\% {{< /katex >}}

#### **3.2 Net Profit Margin**

**Formula:** 

{{< katex >}} \text{Net Profit Margin} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Revenue}} \times 100 {{< /katex >}}

**Explanation:** This ratio measures the percentage of revenue that remains as profit after all expenses are deducted. A higher margin indicates better profitability.

**Example:** If net income is $50,000 and revenue is $500,000, the net profit margin is:

{{< katex >}} \frac{50,000}{500,000} \times 100 = 10\% {{< /katex >}}

### **4. Efficiency Ratios**

Efficiency ratios assess how well a company utilizes its assets and liabilities to generate sales and maximize profits.

#### **4.1 Asset Turnover Ratio**

**Formula:** 

{{< katex >}} \text{Asset Turnover Ratio} = \frac{\text{Revenue}}{\text{Average Total Assets}} {{< /katex >}}

**Explanation:** This ratio indicates how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales. A higher ratio suggests better efficiency.

**Example:** With revenue of $500,000 and average total assets of $250,000, the asset turnover ratio is:

{{< katex >}} \frac{500,000}{250,000} = 2.0 {{< /katex >}}

#### **4.2 Inventory Turnover Ratio**

**Formula:** 

{{< katex >}} \text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \frac{\text{Cost of Goods Sold}}{\text{Average Inventory}} {{< /katex >}}

**Explanation:** This ratio measures how often inventory is sold and replaced over a period. A higher ratio indicates efficient inventory management.

**Example:** If COGS is $300,000 and average inventory is $100,000, the inventory turnover ratio is:

{{< katex >}} \frac{300,000}{100,000} = 3.0 {{< /katex >}}

### **5. Market Value Ratios**

Market value ratios provide insights into the market perception of a company's financial performance and future prospects.

#### **5.1 Earnings Per Share (EPS)**

**Formula:** 

{{< katex >}} \text{EPS} = \frac{\text{Net Income} - \text{Preferred Dividends}}{\text{Average Outstanding Shares}} {{< /katex >}}

**Explanation:** EPS indicates the portion of a company's profit allocated to each outstanding share, reflecting profitability.

**Example:** With net income of $100,000, preferred dividends of $10,000, and average outstanding shares of 18,000, EPS is:

{{< katex >}} \frac{100,000 - 10,000}{18,000} = 5.0 {{< /katex >}}

#### **5.2 Price/Earnings (P/E) Ratio**

**Formula:** 

{{< katex >}} \text{P/E Ratio} = \frac{\text{Market Price per Share}}{\text{Earnings per Share}} {{< /katex >}}

**Explanation:** This ratio measures a company's current share price relative to its EPS, indicating market expectations of future earnings.

**Example:** If the market price per share is $50 and EPS is $5, the P/E ratio is:

{{< katex >}} \frac{50}{5} = 10 {{< /katex >}}

### **6. Dividend Ratios**

Dividend ratios provide insights into a company's dividend policy and its ability to distribute profits to shareholders.

#### **6.1 Dividend Yield**

**Formula:** 

{{< katex >}} \text{Dividend Yield} = \frac{\text{Annual Dividends per Share}}{\text{Market Price per Share}} \times 100 {{< /katex >}}

**Explanation:** This ratio shows the return on investment from dividends alone, expressed as a percentage of the share price.

**Example:** With annual dividends per share of $2 and a market price per share of $50, the dividend yield is:

{{< katex >}} \frac{2}{50} \times 100 = 4\% {{< /katex >}}

#### **6.2 Dividend Payout Ratio**

**Formula:** 

{{< katex >}} \text{Dividend Payout Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Dividends}}{\text{Net Income}} \times 100 {{< /katex >}}

**Explanation:** This ratio indicates the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends to shareholders, reflecting the company's dividend policy.

**Example:** If total dividends are $20,000 and net income is $100,000, the dividend payout ratio is:

{{< katex >}} \frac{20,000}{100,000} \times 100 = 20\% {{< /katex >}}

### **7. Comprehensive Analysis and Application**

Understanding these ratios and their applications is crucial for analyzing financial statements effectively. They provide a comprehensive view of a company's financial health, guiding investment decisions and strategic planning.

#### **7.1 Real-World Application**

Consider a scenario where you are evaluating a potential investment in a Canadian manufacturing company. By applying these ratios, you can assess the company's liquidity, solvency, profitability, and market value, helping you make informed decisions.

#### **7.2 Regulatory Considerations**

In Canada, financial reporting must comply with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) or Accounting Standards for Private Enterprises (ASPE). Understanding these standards is essential for accurate financial analysis and compliance.

### **8. Conclusion**
