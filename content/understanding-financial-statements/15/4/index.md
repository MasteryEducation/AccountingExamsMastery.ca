## 15.4 Financial Ratios Relevant to Small Businesses

Understanding financial ratios is crucial for small business owners and managers to assess the financial health and performance of their businesses. These ratios provide insights into various aspects of a business's operations, including liquidity, profitability, efficiency, and solvency. In this section, we will explore the most relevant financial ratios for small businesses, explain their significance, and demonstrate how to calculate and interpret them. This knowledge is not only essential for internal management but also for communicating with investors, lenders, and other stakeholders.

### Introduction to Financial Ratios

Financial ratios are quantitative measures derived from a company's financial statements. They are used to evaluate a company's performance and financial condition. For small businesses, these ratios can highlight strengths, pinpoint weaknesses, and guide strategic decision-making. By comparing these ratios to industry benchmarks, small business owners can better understand their competitive position.

### Liquidity Ratios

Liquidity ratios measure a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations. They are crucial for small businesses as they indicate the company's capacity to pay off its debts as they come due.

#### 1. Current Ratio

**Formula:** 
{{< katex >}} \text{Current Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{Current Liabilities}} {{< /katex >}}

**Significance:** A current ratio greater than 1 indicates that the company has more current assets than current liabilities, suggesting good short-term financial health. A ratio below 1 may signal liquidity issues.

**Example:** If a small business has current assets of $150,000 and current liabilities of $100,000, the current ratio is 1.5, indicating a strong liquidity position.

#### 2. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)

**Formula:** 
{{< katex >}} \text{Quick Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets} - \text{Inventory}}{\text{Current Liabilities}} {{< /katex >}}

**Significance:** The quick ratio provides a more stringent test of liquidity by excluding inventory, which may not be easily converted to cash. A ratio above 1 is generally favorable.

**Example:** With current assets of $150,000, inventory of $50,000, and current liabilities of $100,000, the quick ratio is 1.0, suggesting adequate liquidity without relying on inventory sales.

### Profitability Ratios

Profitability ratios assess a company's ability to generate profit relative to its revenue, assets, or equity. These ratios are vital for small businesses to ensure sustainable growth and attract investors.

#### 3. Gross Profit Margin

**Formula:** 
{{< katex >}} \text{Gross Profit Margin} = \left( \frac{\text{Revenue} - \text{Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)}}{\text{Revenue}} \right) \times 100 {{< /katex >}}

**Significance:** This ratio indicates the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold, reflecting the efficiency of production and pricing strategies.

**Example:** If a business has revenue of $200,000 and COGS of $120,000, the gross profit margin is 40%, indicating that 40% of revenue is retained after covering the cost of goods.

#### 4. Net Profit Margin

**Formula:** 
{{< katex >}} \text{Net Profit Margin} = \left( \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Revenue}} \right) \times 100 {{< /katex >}}

**Significance:** This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that remains as profit after all expenses are deducted. A higher net profit margin indicates better profitability.

**Example:** With a net income of $30,000 and revenue of $200,000, the net profit margin is 15%, suggesting efficient cost management.

#### 5. Return on Assets (ROA)

**Formula:** 
{{< katex >}} \text{ROA} = \left( \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Total Assets}} \right) \times 100 {{< /katex >}}

**Significance:** ROA measures how effectively a company utilizes its assets to generate profit. A higher ROA indicates efficient use of assets.

**Example:** If a small business has net income of $30,000 and total assets of $300,000, the ROA is 10%, showing effective asset utilization.

#### 6. Return on Equity (ROE)

**Formula:** 
{{< katex >}} \text{ROE} = \left( \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Shareholder's Equity}} \right) \times 100 {{< /katex >}}

**Significance:** ROE indicates how well a company uses shareholders' equity to generate profit. A higher ROE is favorable for attracting investors.

**Example:** With net income of $30,000 and shareholder's equity of $150,000, the ROE is 20%, reflecting strong profitability relative to equity.

### Efficiency Ratios

Efficiency ratios evaluate how effectively a company uses its assets and liabilities to generate sales and maximize profits.

#### 7. Inventory Turnover Ratio

**Formula:** 
{{< katex >}} \text{Inventory Turnover} = \frac{\text{Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)}}{\text{Average Inventory}} {{< /katex >}}

**Significance:** This ratio measures how quickly inventory is sold and replaced. A higher turnover indicates efficient inventory management.

**Example:** If COGS is $120,000 and average inventory is $30,000, the inventory turnover ratio is 4, meaning the inventory is sold and replaced four times a year.

#### 8. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio

**Formula:** 
{{< katex >}} \text{Accounts Receivable Turnover} = \frac{\text{Net Credit Sales}}{\text{Average Accounts Receivable}} {{< /katex >}}

**Significance:** This ratio assesses how efficiently a company collects its receivables. A higher ratio indicates effective credit and collection processes.

**Example:** With net credit sales of $180,000 and average accounts receivable of $30,000, the turnover ratio is 6, suggesting efficient receivables management.

#### 9. Total Asset Turnover Ratio

**Formula:** 
{{< katex >}} \text{Total Asset Turnover} = \frac{\text{Net Sales}}{\text{Total Assets}} {{< /katex >}}

**Significance:** This ratio measures how effectively a company uses its assets to generate sales. A higher ratio indicates better asset utilization.

**Example:** If net sales are $200,000 and total assets are $300,000, the total asset turnover ratio is 0.67, indicating moderate asset efficiency.

### Solvency Ratios

Solvency ratios evaluate a company's ability to meet its long-term obligations, which is crucial for assessing financial stability.

#### 10. Debt to Equity Ratio

**Formula:** 
{{< katex >}} \text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Liabilities}}{\text{Shareholder's Equity}} {{< /katex >}}

**Significance:** This ratio indicates the proportion of debt used to finance the company's assets relative to equity. A lower ratio is generally favorable, indicating less reliance on debt.

**Example:** With total liabilities of $100,000 and shareholder's equity of $150,000, the debt to equity ratio is 0.67, suggesting a balanced capital structure.

#### 11. Interest Coverage Ratio

**Formula:** 
{{< katex >}} \text{Interest Coverage Ratio} = \frac{\text{EBIT}}{\text{Interest Expense}} {{< /katex >}}

**Significance:** This ratio measures a company's ability to pay interest on its outstanding debt. A higher ratio indicates better financial health and lower risk of default.

**Example:** If EBIT is $50,000 and interest expense is $10,000, the interest coverage ratio is 5, indicating strong interest payment capability.

### Market Value Ratios

Market value ratios provide insights into a company's stock market performance and investor perceptions.

#### 12. Price to Earnings (P/E) Ratio

**Formula:** 
{{< katex >}} \text{P/E Ratio} = \frac{\text{Market Price per Share}}{\text{Earnings per Share (EPS)}} {{< /katex >}}

**Significance:** This ratio indicates how much investors are willing to pay per dollar of earnings. A higher P/E suggests higher growth expectations.

**Example:** With a market price per share of $20 and EPS of $2, the P/E ratio is 10, indicating moderate investor expectations.

#### 13. Dividend Yield

**Formula:** 
{{< katex >}} \text{Dividend Yield} = \left( \frac{\text{Annual Dividends per Share}}{\text{Market Price per Share}} \right) \times 100 {{< /katex >}}

**Significance:** This ratio shows the return on investment from dividends. A higher yield is attractive to income-focused investors.

**Example:** If annual dividends per share are $1 and the market price per share is $20, the dividend yield is 5%, offering a solid return.
