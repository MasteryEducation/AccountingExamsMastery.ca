## 24.8 Integrated Reporting Framework

### Introduction to Integrated Reporting

Integrated Reporting (IR) is an innovative approach to corporate reporting that aims to provide a holistic view of an organization's strategy, governance, performance, and prospects in the context of its external environment. It emphasizes the interconnectedness of financial and non-financial factors and how they contribute to value creation over time. The International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) developed the Integrated Reporting Framework to guide organizations in preparing integrated reports.

In Canada, the adoption of Integrated Reporting is gaining traction as organizations recognize the importance of sustainability and environmental considerations in their business models. This section explores the principles, components, and benefits of the Integrated Reporting Framework, providing Canadian accountants with the knowledge to implement and leverage IR effectively.

### The Principles of Integrated Reporting

The Integrated Reporting Framework is built on several guiding principles that ensure the report is concise, relevant, and valuable to stakeholders. These principles include:

1. **Strategic Focus and Future Orientation**: Integrated Reporting highlights an organization's strategy and how it relates to its ability to create value over the short, medium, and long term. This principle encourages organizations to communicate their strategic objectives and the challenges they face in achieving them.

2. **Connectivity of Information**: Integrated Reporting emphasizes the interconnections between various elements of the organization's operations. It requires organizations to demonstrate how financial and non-financial factors are linked and how they influence value creation.

3. **Stakeholder Relationships**: Recognizing the importance of stakeholders in the value creation process, Integrated Reporting encourages organizations to disclose how they engage with stakeholders and consider their needs and expectations.

4. **Materiality**: Integrated Reporting focuses on material information that affects the organization's ability to create value. This principle requires organizations to identify and report on issues that are significant to their stakeholders and their business model.

5. **Conciseness**: Integrated reports should be concise and avoid unnecessary detail. This principle ensures that reports are accessible and easy to understand, providing stakeholders with the information they need without overwhelming them.

6. **Reliability and Completeness**: Integrated Reporting requires organizations to provide reliable and complete information, ensuring that stakeholders can trust the report's content.

7. **Consistency and Comparability**: Integrated reports should be consistent over time and comparable with other organizations. This principle allows stakeholders to track an organization's progress and compare it with peers.

### Components of an Integrated Report

An integrated report typically includes the following components:

1. **Organizational Overview and External Environment**: This section provides an overview of the organization's structure, business model, and the external environment in which it operates. It highlights the key factors affecting the organization's ability to create value.

2. **Governance**: The governance section outlines the organization's governance structure and how it supports value creation. It includes information on the board of directors, management, and their roles in overseeing the organization's strategy and performance.

3. **Business Model**: The business model section describes how the organization creates, delivers, and captures value. It outlines the key resources and processes involved in the organization's operations.

4. **Risks and Opportunities**: This section identifies the key risks and opportunities that affect the organization's ability to create value. It includes information on how the organization manages these risks and capitalizes on opportunities.

5. **Strategy and Resource Allocation**: The strategy section outlines the organization's strategic objectives and how it allocates resources to achieve them. It includes information on the organization's priorities and how they align with its value creation goals.

6. **Performance**: The performance section provides an overview of the organization's financial and non-financial performance. It includes key performance indicators (KPIs) and other metrics that demonstrate the organization's progress toward its strategic objectives.

7. **Outlook**: The outlook section provides insights into the organization's future prospects and challenges. It includes information on the organization's plans and how it intends to address potential challenges.

8. **Basis of Preparation and Presentation**: This section outlines the principles and methods used to prepare the integrated report. It includes information on the organization's reporting boundaries and how it determines materiality.

### Benefits of Integrated Reporting

6. **Preparing the Integrated Report**: Organizations should prepare the integrated report, ensuring it is concise, relevant, and valuable to stakeholders. The report should highlight the organization's strategy, performance, and prospects in the context of its external environment.

7. **Reviewing and Improving the Report**: Organizations should review the integrated report and seek feedback from stakeholders. This feedback helps organizations improve the report and enhance its value to stakeholders.

### Challenges and Best Practices

Implementing Integrated Reporting can present several challenges:

1. **Data Collection and Analysis**: Collecting and analyzing data on financial and non-financial performance can be challenging. Organizations should establish robust data collection and analysis processes to ensure the reliability of the integrated report.
