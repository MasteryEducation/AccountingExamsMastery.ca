## 26.3 Financial Statement Templates

Financial statements are the backbone of financial reporting, providing a structured representation of a company's financial performance and position. In Canada, these statements must comply with either International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) or Accounting Standards for Private Enterprises (ASPE), depending on the entity's nature. This section provides comprehensive templates for the primary financial statements, including the Statement of Financial Position (Balance Sheet), Statement of Comprehensive Income (Income Statement), and Statement of Cash Flows. These templates are designed to align with Canadian accounting standards and offer practical examples to aid understanding.

### 1. Statement of Financial Position (Balance Sheet)

The Statement of Financial Position, commonly known as the Balance Sheet, provides a snapshot of an entity's financial position at a specific point in time. It details the company's assets, liabilities, and equity, offering insights into its financial health and capital structure.
