## 8.4 Property, Plant, and Equipment

Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE) are tangible assets that are held for use in the production or supply of goods and services, for rental to others, or for administrative purposes, and are expected to be used during more than one period. In Canada, the accounting for PPE is governed by two primary sets of standards: the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for publicly accountable enterprises and the Accounting Standards for Private Enterprises (ASPE) for private companies. This section will delve into the key differences between these standards, focusing on recognition, measurement, depreciation, and disclosure requirements.

### Recognition of Property, Plant, and Equipment

#### IFRS Perspective

Under IFRS, specifically IAS 16 "Property, Plant and Equipment," an item of PPE should be recognized as an asset if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the entity and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. This principle emphasizes the need for a clear expectation of benefit and reliable measurement.

#### ASPE Perspective

ASPE Section 3061 "Property, Plant and Equipment" provides similar criteria for recognition, requiring that the asset be expected to provide future economic benefits and that its cost can be reliably measured. However, ASPE tends to offer more flexibility in judgment, which can be beneficial for smaller enterprises with less complex operations.

### Measurement at Recognition

#### Initial Measurement

Both IFRS and ASPE require PPE to be initially measured at cost. This cost includes the purchase price, any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management, and an estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located.

#### Subsequent Measurement

**IFRS Approach:**

Under IFRS, entities have the option to measure PPE using either the cost model or the revaluation model:

- **Cost Model:** The asset is carried at its cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
- **Revaluation Model:** The asset is carried at a revalued amount, being its fair value at the date of the revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses. Revaluations must be made with sufficient regularity to ensure that the carrying amount does not differ materially from that which would be determined using fair value at the end of the reporting period.

**ASPE Approach:**

ASPE only allows the cost model for subsequent measurement. This means that once an asset is recognized, it is carried at its cost less any accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment losses. The lack of a revaluation model under ASPE simplifies accounting for PPE but may not reflect the current market value of assets.

### Depreciation

Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life. Both IFRS and ASPE require depreciation to be recognized, but there are differences in the approach and flexibility allowed.

#### IFRS Depreciation

Under IFRS, depreciation methods should reflect the pattern in which the asset’s future economic benefits are expected to be consumed by the entity. Common methods include the straight-line method, diminishing balance method, and units of production method. Changes in depreciation method or useful life are accounted for as changes in accounting estimates.

#### ASPE Depreciation

ASPE also requires that depreciation reflect the pattern of economic benefits consumption. However, ASPE provides more flexibility in selecting a depreciation method, which can be particularly useful for private enterprises that may have unique asset usage patterns. Changes in depreciation methods or estimates are treated similarly to IFRS.

### Impairment of Property, Plant, and Equipment

#### IFRS Impairment

IAS 36 "Impairment of Assets" governs the impairment of PPE under IFRS. An asset is impaired when its carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Entities must assess at each reporting date whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired.

#### ASPE Impairment

ASPE Section 3063 "Impairment of Long-lived Assets" requires a similar impairment test. However, the recoverable amount is defined as the net recoverable amount, which is the fair value less costs to sell, or the value in use, whichever is higher. The approach to impairment under ASPE is generally considered less rigorous than under IFRS.

### Derecognition of Property, Plant, and Equipment

Derecognition occurs when an asset is disposed of or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal.

#### IFRS Derecognition

Under IFRS, the gain or loss arising from the derecognition of an item of PPE is included in profit or loss when the item is derecognized. The gain or loss is calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset.

#### ASPE Derecognition

ASPE follows a similar approach to IFRS in terms of derecognition, with gains or losses recognized in income. However, ASPE provides more guidance on the presentation of these gains or losses, which can be advantageous for smaller enterprises.

### Disclosure Requirements

#### IFRS Disclosure

IFRS requires extensive disclosures for PPE, including:

- Measurement bases used for determining the gross carrying amount.
- Depreciation methods used.
- Useful lives or depreciation rates used.
- Gross carrying amount and accumulated depreciation at the beginning and end of the period.
- Reconciliation of the carrying amount at the beginning and end of the period.
- Existence and amounts of restrictions on title, and PPE pledged as security for liabilities.
- Contractual commitments for the acquisition of PPE.

#### ASPE Disclosure

ASPE requires less extensive disclosures compared to IFRS, focusing on:

- The basis of measurement.
- Depreciation methods and rates.
- The net carrying amount at the end of the period.
- The amount of PPE pledged as security.

### Practical Examples and Case Studies

#### Example 1: Initial Recognition

Consider a Canadian manufacturing company that purchases a new machine for $100,000. The company incurs $5,000 in transportation costs and $3,000 in installation costs. Under both IFRS and ASPE, the initial cost of the machine would be recognized at $108,000 ($100,000 + $5,000 + $3,000).

#### Example 2: Revaluation Model under IFRS

A public company in Canada owns a building with a carrying amount of $500,000. The fair value of the building is determined to be $600,000. Under the revaluation model allowed by IFRS, the company can revalue the building to $600,000, recognizing a revaluation surplus of $100,000 in other comprehensive income.

#### Example 3: Impairment Test

A Canadian retailer experiences a decline in sales, indicating potential impairment of its store fixtures. The carrying amount of the fixtures is $200,000, while the recoverable amount is determined to be $150,000. Under both IFRS and ASPE, the company would recognize an impairment loss of $50,000.

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

- **Best Practice:** Regularly review the useful lives and depreciation methods of PPE to ensure they reflect the actual usage and economic benefits derived from the assets.
- **Common Pitfall:** Failing to recognize impairment losses in a timely manner can lead to overstated asset values and financial statements.
- **Strategy:** Implement robust internal controls and regular asset reviews to identify potential impairments early.

### Summary

Understanding the differences in accounting for Property, Plant, and Equipment under IFRS and ASPE is crucial for Canadian accountants, especially those preparing for exams. While both frameworks share common principles, the flexibility and specific requirements of each can significantly impact financial reporting. By mastering these differences, you can ensure accurate and compliant financial statements, whether working with public or private enterprises.
