## 15.2 Ratio Analysis

Ratio analysis is a powerful tool used by accountants, investors, and financial analysts to evaluate the financial health of a business. By examining relationships between various financial statement items, ratio analysis provides insights into a company's liquidity, solvency, and profitability. This section will guide you through the calculation and interpretation of key financial ratios, with a focus on their application in the Canadian context.

### Understanding Ratio Analysis

Ratio analysis involves comparing different figures from financial statements to assess a company's performance and financial condition. Ratios can be categorized into three main types:

1. **Liquidity Ratios**: Measure a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations.
2. **Solvency Ratios**: Assess a company's capacity to meet its long-term debts.
3. **Profitability Ratios**: Evaluate a company's ability to generate profit relative to its revenue, assets, or equity.

Each type of ratio provides a different perspective on the company's financial health, and together, they offer a comprehensive view of its financial performance.

### Liquidity Ratios

Liquidity ratios are crucial for understanding a company's ability to cover its short-term liabilities with its short-term assets. Key liquidity ratios include:

#### 1. Current Ratio

The current ratio measures a company's ability to pay its short-term obligations with its short-term assets. It is calculated as:

{{< katex >}} \text{Current Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{Current Liabilities}} {{< /katex >}}

- **Interpretation**: A current ratio above 1 indicates that the company has more current assets than current liabilities, suggesting good short-term financial health. However, an excessively high ratio may indicate inefficient use of resources.

#### 2. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)

The quick ratio provides a more stringent test of liquidity by excluding inventory from current assets. It is calculated as:

{{< katex >}} \text{Quick Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets} - \text{Inventory}}{\text{Current Liabilities}} {{< /katex >}}

- **Interpretation**: A quick ratio greater than 1 is generally favorable, indicating that the company can meet its short-term obligations without relying on the sale of inventory.

#### 3. Cash Ratio

The cash ratio measures the extent to which a company can pay off its current liabilities with cash and cash equivalents. It is calculated as:

{{< katex >}} \text{Cash Ratio} = \frac{\text{Cash and Cash Equivalents}}{\text{Current Liabilities}} {{< /katex >}}

- **Interpretation**: This ratio is the most conservative liquidity measure. A higher cash ratio indicates a strong liquidity position, but an excessively high ratio might suggest underutilization of cash.

### Solvency Ratios

Solvency ratios evaluate a company's ability to meet its long-term obligations and sustain operations over the long term. Key solvency ratios include:

#### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio

The debt to equity ratio compares a company's total liabilities to its shareholders' equity, indicating the proportion of debt used to finance the company. It is calculated as:

{{< katex >}} \text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Liabilities}}{\text{Shareholders' Equity}} {{< /katex >}}

- **Interpretation**: A higher ratio suggests greater financial leverage and risk, as the company relies more on debt financing. A lower ratio indicates a more conservative financial structure.

#### 2. Interest Coverage Ratio

The interest coverage ratio measures a company's ability to pay interest on its outstanding debt. It is calculated as:

{{< katex >}} \text{Interest Coverage Ratio} = \frac{\text{Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT)}}{\text{Interest Expense}} {{< /katex >}}

- **Interpretation**: A higher ratio indicates that the company comfortably meets its interest obligations, while a ratio below 1 suggests potential difficulties in servicing debt.

#### 3. Debt Ratio

The debt ratio assesses the proportion of a company's assets financed by debt. It is calculated as:

{{< katex >}} \text{Debt Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Liabilities}}{\text{Total Assets}} {{< /katex >}}

- **Interpretation**: A higher debt ratio indicates greater financial risk, as more assets are financed through debt. A lower ratio suggests a more stable financial position.

### Profitability Ratios

Profitability ratios measure a company's ability to generate profit relative to its revenue, assets, or equity. Key profitability ratios include:

#### 1. Gross Profit Margin

The gross profit margin indicates the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It is calculated as:

{{< katex >}} \text{Gross Profit Margin} = \frac{\text{Revenue} - \text{COGS}}{\text{Revenue}} \times 100 {{< /katex >}}

- **Interpretation**: A higher gross profit margin indicates efficient production and pricing strategies, while a lower margin suggests potential issues with cost control or pricing.

#### 2. Net Profit Margin

The net profit margin measures the percentage of revenue remaining after all expenses have been deducted. It is calculated as:

{{< katex >}} \text{Net Profit Margin} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Revenue}} \times 100 {{< /katex >}}

- **Interpretation**: A higher net profit margin indicates strong profitability and effective cost management, while a lower margin suggests potential inefficiencies or high expenses.

#### 3. Return on Assets (ROA)

ROA measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate profit. It is calculated as:

{{< katex >}} \text{Return on Assets} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Total Assets}} \times 100 {{< /katex >}}

- **Interpretation**: A higher ROA indicates efficient asset utilization and strong profitability, while a lower ROA suggests potential inefficiencies in asset management.

#### 4. Return on Equity (ROE)

ROE measures a company's ability to generate profit from its shareholders' equity. It is calculated as:

{{< katex >}} \text{Return on Equity} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Shareholders' Equity}} \times 100 {{< /katex >}}

- **Interpretation**: A higher ROE indicates effective use of equity capital to generate profit, while a lower ROE suggests potential challenges in generating returns for shareholders.

### Practical Examples and Case Studies

To illustrate the application of ratio analysis, let's consider a hypothetical Canadian company, MapleTech Inc. We'll calculate and interpret key financial ratios based on the following financial data:

- **Current Assets**: $500,000
- **Inventory**: $100,000
- **Current Liabilities**: $300,000
- **Total Liabilities**: $700,000
- **Shareholders' Equity**: $800,000
- **Revenue**: $1,000,000
- **COGS**: $600,000
- **Net Income**: $150,000
- **Interest Expense**: $20,000
- **Total Assets**: $1,500,000

#### Liquidity Ratios for MapleTech Inc.

1. **Current Ratio**: 

{{< katex >}} \text{Current Ratio} = \frac{500,000}{300,000} = 1.67 {{< /katex >}}

- **Interpretation**: MapleTech Inc. has $1.67 in current assets for every $1 of current liabilities, indicating good short-term financial health.

2. **Quick Ratio**:

{{< katex >}} \text{Quick Ratio} = \frac{500,000 - 100,000}{300,000} = 1.33 {{< /katex >}}

- **Interpretation**: MapleTech Inc. can meet its short-term obligations without relying on inventory sales, with a quick ratio of 1.33.

3. **Cash Ratio**:

Assuming cash and cash equivalents are $200,000:

{{< katex >}} \text{Cash Ratio} = \frac{200,000}{300,000} = 0.67 {{< /katex >}}

- **Interpretation**: MapleTech Inc. has $0.67 in cash for every $1 of current liabilities, suggesting a moderate liquidity position.

#### Solvency Ratios for MapleTech Inc.

1. **Debt to Equity Ratio**:

{{< katex >}} \text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \frac{700,000}{800,000} = 0.875 {{< /katex >}}

- **Interpretation**: MapleTech Inc. has a conservative financial structure, with $0.875 in debt for every $1 of equity.

2. **Interest Coverage Ratio**:

{{< katex >}} \text{Interest Coverage Ratio} = \frac{150,000}{20,000} = 7.5 {{< /katex >}}

- **Interpretation**: MapleTech Inc. can comfortably cover its interest expenses 7.5 times over, indicating strong solvency.

3. **Debt Ratio**:

{{< katex >}} \text{Debt Ratio} = \frac{700,000}{1,500,000} = 0.467 {{< /katex >}}

- **Interpretation**: MapleTech Inc. has 46.7% of its assets financed by debt, suggesting a balanced financial position.

#### Profitability Ratios for MapleTech Inc.

1. **Gross Profit Margin**:

{{< katex >}} \text{Gross Profit Margin} = \frac{1,000,000 - 600,000}{1,000,000} \times 100 = 40\% {{< /katex >}}

- **Interpretation**: MapleTech Inc. retains 40% of its revenue after covering COGS, indicating efficient production and pricing.

2. **Net Profit Margin**:

{{< katex >}} \text{Net Profit Margin} = \frac{150,000}{1,000,000} \times 100 = 15\% {{< /katex >}}

- **Interpretation**: MapleTech Inc. retains 15% of its revenue as profit, reflecting strong profitability.

3. **Return on Assets (ROA)**:

{{< katex >}} \text{Return on Assets} = \frac{150,000}{1,500,000} \times 100 = 10\% {{< /katex >}}

- **Interpretation**: MapleTech Inc. generates a 10% return on its assets, indicating efficient asset utilization.

4. **Return on Equity (ROE)**:

{{< katex >}} \text{Return on Equity} = \frac{150,000}{800,000} \times 100 = 18.75\% {{< /katex >}}

- **Interpretation**: MapleTech Inc. generates an 18.75% return on equity, demonstrating effective use of equity capital.

### Real-World Applications and Regulatory Scenarios
