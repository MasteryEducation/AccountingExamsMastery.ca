## 22.2 Roles and Responsibilities of Boards and Committees

In the realm of corporate governance, the roles and responsibilities of boards and committees are pivotal to ensuring the integrity, accountability, and strategic direction of an organization. This section delves into the intricate structures and duties of boards and committees, particularly within the Canadian context, highlighting their influence on financial reporting, compliance, and overall corporate performance.

### Understanding Corporate Governance

Corporate governance refers to the system by which companies are directed and controlled. It involves a set of relationships between a company’s management, its board, its shareholders, and other stakeholders. The board of directors plays a critical role in governance, tasked with overseeing the management of the company and ensuring that the interests of shareholders and other stakeholders are protected.

### The Board of Directors: Structure and Responsibilities

The board of directors is the cornerstone of corporate governance. It is responsible for providing strategic guidance, oversight, and accountability. In Canada, boards are typically composed of a mix of executive and non-executive directors, with a strong emphasis on independence to ensure unbiased decision-making.

#### Key Responsibilities of the Board of Directors

1. **Strategic Oversight:**
   - The board is responsible for setting the strategic direction of the company. This involves approving major corporate plans, budgets, and policies, and ensuring that the company’s objectives align with shareholder interests.

2. **Financial Oversight:**
   - Boards must ensure the integrity of financial reporting. This includes approving financial statements, overseeing the audit process, and ensuring compliance with Canadian accounting standards such as IFRS and ASPE.

3. **Risk Management:**
   - Identifying and managing risks is a critical board function. Boards must ensure that robust risk management frameworks are in place to mitigate potential threats to the company’s operations and financial health.

6. **Succession Planning:**

### Committees of the Board

To effectively manage their responsibilities, boards often delegate specific tasks to committees. These committees focus on particular areas of governance and report back to the full board. Common committees include the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and Governance Committee.

  - Developing and recommending compensation packages for senior executives.

- **Performance-Based Incentives:**
  - Designing incentive programs that align executive performance with shareholder interests.
