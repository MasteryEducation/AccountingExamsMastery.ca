## 9.7 Financial Assets and Investments

Financial assets and investments are crucial components of an entity's balance sheet, representing the resources that an organization holds to generate future economic benefits. In Canada, accounting for financial assets and investments is governed by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Accounting Standards for Private Enterprises (ASPE). This section will provide a comprehensive overview of the principles, recognition, measurement, and reporting requirements for financial assets and investments, tailored to the Canadian context.

### Understanding Financial Assets

Financial assets are defined as any asset that is:

1. Cash;
2. An equity instrument of another entity;
3. A contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset from another entity;
4. A contractual right to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another entity under conditions that are potentially favorable.

#### Types of Financial Assets

1. **Cash and Cash Equivalents**: These include currency, bank balances, and short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less.

2. **Receivables**: Amounts due from customers or other parties, typically arising from sales transactions.

3. **Investments in Securities**: These can be debt securities (such as bonds) or equity securities (such as shares).

4. **Derivatives**: Financial instruments whose value is derived from the value of an underlying asset, index, or rate.

5. **Loans and Advances**: Amounts lent to borrowers, which may include interest-bearing loans.

### Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets

#### Initial Recognition

Financial assets are initially recognized at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition. The fair value is generally the transaction price unless there is evidence to the contrary.

#### Subsequent Measurement

The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification under IFRS 9, which includes:

1. **Amortized Cost**: Financial assets held in a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows, where the cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest.

2. **Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI)**: Financial assets held in a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets.

3. **Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL)**: Financial assets that do not meet the criteria for amortized cost or FVOCI.

Under ASPE, financial assets are classified into two categories:

1. **Held for Trading**: Measured at fair value with changes recognized in profit or loss.
2. **Available for Sale**: Measured at fair value with changes recognized in other comprehensive income.

#### Impairment of Financial Assets

Under IFRS 9, the impairment model is based on expected credit losses (ECL), which requires entities to account for expected credit losses from the time the financial asset is recognized. This model applies to financial assets measured at amortized cost or FVOCI.

ASPE requires an impairment test for financial assets at each reporting date, with any impairment recognized in profit or loss.

### Investments in Securities

Investments in securities can be classified into debt and equity instruments. The accounting treatment for these investments varies based on their classification and the applicable accounting standards.

#### Debt Instruments

Debt instruments, such as bonds, are typically measured at amortized cost or fair value, depending on the business model and cash flow characteristics. Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method.

#### Equity Instruments

Equity instruments, such as shares, are generally measured at fair value. Under IFRS, changes in fair value are recognized in profit or loss unless an irrevocable election is made to present changes in other comprehensive income for equity instruments that are not held for trading.

### Accounting for Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures

Investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method under IFRS. This method involves recognizing the investor's share of the investee's profit or loss in the investor's profit or loss, and adjusting the carrying amount of the investment for the investor's share of changes in the investee's equity.

Under ASPE, investments in associates can be accounted for using the cost method or the equity method.

### Consolidation of Investments

When an entity has control over another entity, it must consolidate the financial statements of the subsidiary with its own. Control is defined as having power over the investee, exposure or rights to variable returns from involvement with the investee, and the ability to use power to affect those returns.

### Practical Examples and Case Studies

#### Example 1: Accounting for a Bond Investment

Company A purchases a bond with a face value of $1,000,000, a coupon rate of 5%, and a maturity of 10 years. The bond is purchased at a discount for $950,000. Under IFRS, Company A would recognize the bond at its fair value of $950,000 and amortize the discount over the life of the bond using the effective interest method.

#### Example 2: Equity Investment with FVOCI Election

Company B invests in shares of Company C, which are not held for trading. Company B makes an irrevocable election to present changes in fair value in other comprehensive income. Any dividends received are recognized in profit or loss, while changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income.

### Regulatory Considerations

Canadian entities must comply with IFRS or ASPE, depending on their classification as public or private enterprises. Publicly accountable enterprises are required to use IFRS, while private enterprises can choose between IFRS and ASPE.

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

#### Best Practices

- Regularly review the classification and measurement of financial assets to ensure compliance with the applicable standards.
- Implement robust internal controls to manage and monitor financial assets and investments.

#### Common Pitfalls

- Misclassification of financial assets, leading to incorrect measurement and reporting.
- Failure to recognize impairment losses in a timely manner.

### Conclusion

Understanding the accounting for financial assets and investments is essential for accurate financial reporting and compliance with Canadian accounting standards. By mastering the principles and applications outlined in this section, you will be well-prepared for the Canadian Accounting Exams and equipped to handle financial assets and investments in professional practice.
