## 9.6 Asset Impairment

Asset impairment is a critical concept in accounting, particularly within the Canadian context, where both International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Accounting Standards for Private Enterprises (ASPE) are applied. Understanding asset impairment is essential for accurately reflecting the financial health of an organization, as it ensures that assets are not overstated on the balance sheet. This section will guide you through the principles, standards, and practices of asset impairment, providing the knowledge necessary to test and record impairment losses effectively.

### Understanding Asset Impairment

Asset impairment occurs when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Impairment testing is crucial because it ensures that the financial statements reflect the true economic value of an asset.

#### Key Terms and Definitions

- **Carrying Amount**: The amount at which an asset is recognized on the balance sheet after deducting accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
  
- **Recoverable Amount**: The higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.

- **Fair Value Less Costs to Sell**: The price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, minus the costs of disposal.

- **Value in Use**: The present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or cash-generating unit (CGU).

### Asset Impairment under IFRS

Under IFRS, asset impairment is governed by IAS 36, "Impairment of Assets." This standard applies to all assets except those specifically excluded, such as inventories, deferred tax assets, and financial assets within the scope of IFRS 9.

#### Impairment Testing Process

1. **Identify Indicators of Impairment**: Indicators can be external (e.g., market value declines) or internal (e.g., physical damage to an asset).

2. **Determine the Recoverable Amount**: Calculate the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.

3. **Compare Carrying Amount with Recoverable Amount**: If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, an impairment loss must be recognized.

4. **Recognize and Measure the Impairment Loss**: The impairment loss is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. It is recognized immediately in profit or loss.

5. **Reversal of Impairment Losses**: If there is an indication that an impairment loss recognized in prior periods may no longer exist or may have decreased, the entity must estimate the recoverable amount. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized in profit or loss.

#### Practical Example

Consider a manufacturing company with a machine that has a carrying amount of $500,000. Due to technological advancements, the market value of similar machines has decreased significantly. The company estimates the fair value less costs to sell at $350,000 and the value in use at $400,000. The recoverable amount is $400,000 (the higher of the two). Since the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, an impairment loss of $100,000 ($500,000 - $400,000) must be recognized.

### Asset Impairment under ASPE

In Canada, private enterprises may use ASPE, where Section 3063, "Impairment of Long-lived Assets," provides guidance on asset impairment. The principles are similar to IFRS but with some differences in application and disclosure requirements.

#### Key Differences between IFRS and ASPE

- **Frequency of Testing**: Under ASPE, impairment testing is conducted when there is an indication that an asset may be impaired, whereas IFRS requires annual testing for certain assets.

- **Reversal of Impairment**: ASPE does not allow the reversal of impairment losses, unlike IFRS.

- **Measurement of Recoverable Amount**: ASPE does not require a comparison between fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Instead, it focuses on the net recoverable amount.

### Steps to Test and Record Asset Impairment

1. **Identify Impairment Indicators**: Regularly review assets for indicators of impairment, such as significant changes in market conditions or asset usage.

2. **Estimate the Recoverable Amount**: Use appropriate valuation techniques to estimate fair value less costs to sell and value in use.

3. **Compare with Carrying Amount**: Determine if the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.

4. **Recognize Impairment Loss**: Record the impairment loss in the financial statements, reducing the asset's carrying amount.

5. **Disclose Impairment Losses**: Provide detailed disclosures in the notes to the financial statements, including the events leading to the impairment and the methods used to determine the recoverable amount.

### Real-World Applications and Regulatory Scenarios

In practice, asset impairment can have significant implications for businesses, affecting financial ratios, borrowing capacity, and investor perceptions. Companies must ensure compliance with relevant standards and provide transparent disclosures to stakeholders.

#### Case Study: Retail Industry

A Canadian retail chain faces declining sales due to increased competition and changing consumer preferences. The company conducts an impairment test on its store fixtures and fittings, resulting in a substantial impairment loss. This loss impacts the company's profitability and necessitates strategic adjustments to its business model.

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

- **Regular Monitoring**: Continuously monitor assets for impairment indicators to ensure timely recognition of losses.

- **Accurate Valuation**: Use reliable and consistent valuation methods to estimate recoverable amounts.

- **Comprehensive Disclosures**: Provide clear and comprehensive disclosures to enhance transparency and stakeholder confidence.

- **Avoiding Over-Optimism**: Be cautious of overly optimistic assumptions in estimating future cash flows or fair values.

### Strategies for Exam Success

- **Understand Key Concepts**: Focus on understanding the principles of asset impairment, including the calculation of recoverable amounts and recognition of impairment losses.

- **Practice with Examples**: Work through practical examples and case studies to reinforce your understanding.

- **Review Standards**: Familiarize yourself with the relevant IFRS and ASPE standards, noting key differences and application requirements.

- **Stay Updated**: Keep abreast of any updates or amendments to accounting standards that may affect asset impairment.

### Summary

Asset impairment is a vital aspect of financial reporting, ensuring that assets are not overstated on the balance sheet. By understanding the principles and processes of impairment testing under both IFRS and ASPE, you can accurately assess and record impairment losses, providing a true reflection of an organization's financial position.

### What is the recoverable amount of an asset?

- [x] The higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use
- [ ] The lower of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use
- [ ] The carrying amount of the asset
- [ ] The historical cost of the asset

> **Explanation:** The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use, as per IFRS standards.
