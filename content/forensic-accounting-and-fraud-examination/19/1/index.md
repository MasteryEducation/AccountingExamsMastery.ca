### The Structure of Corporate Governance

Corporate governance refers to the system by which companies are directed and controlled. It involves a set of relationships between a company’s management, its board, its shareholders, and other stakeholders. The board of directors is at the core of this governance structure, responsible for setting the company’s strategic aims, providing leadership, supervising management, and reporting to shareholders on their stewardship.

#### Board of Directors

The board of directors is the highest governing authority within the management structure of an organization. It is responsible for making critical decisions that affect the organization’s future. The board's primary duties include:

- **Financial Oversight:** Ensuring the integrity of financial information and compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.
- **Ethical Leadership:** Promoting ethical behavior and corporate culture.

#### Committees Within the Board

To enhance efficiency and focus, boards often establish committees to handle specific areas of governance. Key committees include:

- **Audit Committee:** Focuses on financial reporting, internal controls, and the audit process.

### Case Studies and Real-World Examples

To illustrate the role of boards and committees in fraud prevention, consider the following case studies:

The Enron scandal is a prime example of how the failure of corporate governance can lead to fraud. The board of directors failed to exercise adequate oversight, allowing unethical practices to flourish. This case underscores the importance of strong governance structures and vigilant oversight by boards and committees.

#### Case Study: Nortel Networks Corporation

Nortel’s financial misstatements and subsequent collapse highlight the critical role of audit committees in ensuring accurate financial reporting. The lack of effective oversight by the audit committee contributed to the company’s downfall, emphasizing the need for robust audit processes and controls.

### Best Practices for Boards and Committees

### Challenges and Pitfalls

Despite their critical role in fraud prevention, boards and committees face several challenges:

#### Conflicts of Interest

Conflicts of interest can undermine the effectiveness of boards and committees. It is essential to establish policies to identify and manage conflicts of interest.

#### Lack of Expertise

Boards and committees may lack the expertise needed to effectively oversee complex financial and risk management issues. Providing training and seeking external advice can help address this challenge.

#### Resistance to Change
