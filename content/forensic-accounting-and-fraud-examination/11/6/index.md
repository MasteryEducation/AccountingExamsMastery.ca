## 11.6 Dealing with Difficult Interviewees

### Introduction

In the realm of forensic accounting and fraud examination, interviews are a pivotal tool in gathering information and evidence. However, not all interviewees are forthcoming or cooperative. Dealing with difficult interviewees—those who are uncooperative, hostile, or evasive—requires a strategic approach. This section provides comprehensive insights into handling such challenges effectively, ensuring that you can extract the necessary information while maintaining professionalism and adhering to ethical standards.

### Understanding Difficult Interviewees

Difficult interviewees can manifest in various forms, including:

- **Hostile Individuals**: Those who are openly aggressive or confrontational.
- **Evasive Respondents**: Individuals who avoid answering questions directly or provide vague responses.
- **Uncooperative Subjects**: Those who refuse to engage or participate in the interview process.
- **Manipulative Interviewees**: Individuals who attempt to control the interview or mislead the interviewer.

Understanding the underlying reasons for such behaviors is crucial. Factors may include fear of self-incrimination, loyalty to others involved in the fraud, or a general distrust of authority figures. Recognizing these motivations can help tailor your approach to each interviewee.

### Strategies for Handling Difficult Interviewees

#### 1. Preparation and Planning

- **Research and Background Check**: Before the interview, gather as much information as possible about the interviewee. This includes understanding their role within the organization, any potential motives for fraud, and their personal background.
- **Set Clear Objectives**: Define what you aim to achieve from the interview. Having clear objectives will help you steer the conversation and manage any deviations effectively.
- **Develop a Structured Plan**: Outline the key topics and questions you need to cover. A structured plan helps maintain focus and ensures all relevant areas are addressed.

#### 2. Building Rapport

- **Establish Trust**: Begin the interview by creating a comfortable environment. Use open body language, maintain eye contact, and show empathy to build trust.
- **Active Listening**: Demonstrate that you are genuinely interested in the interviewee's responses. This can encourage them to open up and share more information.
- **Use of Neutral Language**: Avoid accusatory or confrontational language. Instead, use neutral terms that do not imply guilt or wrongdoing.

#### 3. Managing Hostility

- **Stay Calm and Professional**: Do not react emotionally to hostility. Maintain a calm demeanor and address any aggressive behavior with professionalism.
- **Acknowledge Emotions**: Recognize and validate the interviewee's feelings without agreeing or disagreeing. This can help defuse tension.
- **Redirect the Conversation**: If the interviewee becomes hostile, gently steer the conversation back to the topic at hand. Use phrases like, "I understand this is frustrating, but let's focus on..."

#### 4. Handling Evasiveness

- **Ask Open-Ended Questions**: Encourage detailed responses by asking questions that cannot be answered with a simple "yes" or "no."
- **Clarify and Probe**: If an answer is vague, ask follow-up questions to clarify and probe deeper into the subject.
- **Summarize and Confirm**: Periodically summarize what the interviewee has said and ask for confirmation. This technique can help ensure accuracy and accountability.

#### 5. Overcoming Uncooperativeness

- **Explain the Importance**: Clearly communicate why the interview is necessary and how the interviewee's cooperation can benefit the investigation.
- **Offer Reassurances**: Address any concerns the interviewee may have about confidentiality or repercussions.
- **Use Persuasion Techniques**: Highlight the potential consequences of non-cooperation, such as legal implications or damage to their reputation.

#### 6. Dealing with Manipulation

- **Stay Focused on Facts**: Do not be swayed by attempts to manipulate the narrative. Stick to factual information and evidence.
- **Challenge Inconsistencies**: Politely point out any discrepancies in the interviewee's statements and ask for clarification.
- **Maintain Control**: Keep the interview on track by redirecting any attempts to derail the conversation.

### Practical Examples and Case Studies

#### Example 1: The Hostile Executive

In a case involving financial statement fraud, a forensic accountant had to interview a senior executive who was known for their aggressive demeanor. By maintaining a calm and professional attitude, the accountant was able to diffuse the executive's hostility. The accountant used active listening and acknowledged the executive's frustrations, which eventually led to a more productive dialogue.

#### Example 2: The Evasive Employee

During an investigation into asset misappropriation, an employee repeatedly provided vague answers. The forensic accountant employed open-ended questions and summarized the employee's responses to ensure clarity. By gently probing for more details, the accountant was able to uncover inconsistencies that pointed to the employee's involvement in the fraud.

#### Example 3: The Uncooperative Witness

A witness in a corruption case was initially uncooperative, fearing retaliation. The forensic accountant explained the importance of the witness's testimony and reassured them about confidentiality measures in place. By building rapport and offering reassurances, the accountant gained the witness's cooperation.

### Legal and Ethical Considerations

When dealing with difficult interviewees, it is essential to adhere to legal and ethical standards. This includes respecting the interviewee's rights, maintaining confidentiality, and avoiding any form of coercion or intimidation. Familiarize yourself with relevant Canadian laws and regulations, such as the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, to ensure compliance.

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

#### Best Practices

- **Prepare Thoroughly**: Comprehensive preparation is key to handling difficult interviews effectively.
- **Adapt Your Approach**: Be flexible and adjust your strategies based on the interviewee's behavior and responses.
- **Document Everything**: Keep detailed records of the interview, including the questions asked and the responses given.

#### Common Pitfalls

- **Losing Composure**: Allowing emotions to influence your behavior can undermine the interview process.
- **Overlooking Non-Verbal Cues**: Pay attention to body language and other non-verbal signals that may provide additional insights.
- **Failing to Follow Up**: If new information arises during the interview, ensure you follow up on it promptly.

### Conclusion

Dealing with difficult interviewees is a challenging yet essential aspect of forensic accounting and fraud examination. By employing the strategies outlined in this section, you can navigate these challenges effectively, ensuring that you gather the necessary information while maintaining professionalism and ethical standards. Remember, each interview is unique, and adapting your approach to the specific circumstances will enhance your effectiveness as a forensic accountant.
