## 12.6 Sales Taxes Payable

Sales taxes payable represent an essential aspect of accounting for businesses operating in Canada. As a liability, sales taxes payable arise from the obligation of businesses to collect sales tax from customers at the point of sale and remit it to the appropriate governmental authorities. Understanding how to accurately account for sales taxes payable is crucial for maintaining compliance with Canadian tax laws and ensuring the integrity of financial reporting. This section will delve into the intricacies of sales taxes payable, including the collection, remittance, and compliance with Canadian accounting standards.

### Understanding Sales Taxes in Canada

Sales taxes in Canada are levied at both the federal and provincial levels, with the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and the Harmonized Sales Tax (HST) being the most common. Some provinces also impose a Provincial Sales Tax (PST). The rates and rules for these taxes can vary significantly between provinces, making it essential for businesses to understand the specific requirements applicable to their operations.

#### Types of Sales Taxes

1. **Goods and Services Tax (GST):** A federal tax applied to most goods and services sold in Canada. The standard rate is 5%, but it can vary depending on the province.

2. **Harmonized Sales Tax (HST):** A combination of GST and PST, applied in provinces that have harmonized their sales tax systems with the federal government. The rate varies by province.

3. **Provincial Sales Tax (PST):** A tax levied by certain provinces on the sale of goods and some services. PST rates and rules differ across provinces.

4. **Quebec Sales Tax (QST):** Similar to GST and PST, but specific to Quebec, with its own set of rules and rates.

### Accounting for Sales Taxes Payable

Sales taxes payable are recorded as a liability on the balance sheet. When a business makes a sale, it collects sales tax from the customer and records it as a liability until it is remitted to the government. The following steps outline the process of accounting for sales taxes payable:

#### Step 1: Collection of Sales Tax

When a sale is made, the business collects the appropriate amount of sales tax from the customer. This amount is added to the sales price and recorded in the accounting system.

**Example:**

A business sells a product for $100 in a province with a 13% HST. The total amount collected from the customer is $113, with $13 representing the sales tax.

#### Step 2: Recording the Sales Tax Payable

The sales tax collected is recorded as a liability in the accounting records. This is typically done using a journal entry that debits the cash or accounts receivable account and credits the sales tax payable account.

**Journal Entry:**

```
Debit: Cash/Accounts Receivable $113
Credit: Sales Revenue $100
Credit: Sales Tax Payable $13
```

#### Step 3: Remittance of Sales Tax

Businesses are required to remit the collected sales taxes to the appropriate tax authorities on a regular basis. The frequency of remittance depends on the size of the business and the amount of sales tax collected.

**Example:**

If the business is required to remit sales taxes monthly, it will prepare a remittance form detailing the total sales tax collected and submit it along with the payment to the tax authority.

#### Step 4: Recording the Remittance

When the sales tax is remitted, the liability is reduced by recording a journal entry that debits the sales tax payable account and credits the cash account.

**Journal Entry:**

```
Debit: Sales Tax Payable $13
Credit: Cash $13
```

### Compliance with Canadian Accounting Standards

Compliance with Canadian accounting standards is crucial for accurately reporting sales taxes payable. The following standards and guidelines are relevant:

1. **International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS):** Adopted by publicly accountable enterprises in Canada, IFRS provides guidance on the recognition and measurement of liabilities, including sales taxes payable.

2. **Accounting Standards for Private Enterprises (ASPE):** Provides guidelines for private enterprises in Canada, including the recognition and measurement of sales taxes payable.

3. **CPA Canada Handbook:** Offers detailed guidance on accounting for sales taxes and other liabilities, ensuring compliance with Canadian standards.

### Practical Examples and Scenarios

To further illustrate the accounting for sales taxes payable, consider the following scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: Retail Business in Ontario

A retail business in Ontario sells goods subject to a 13% HST. The business collects sales tax on each sale and remits it monthly to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).

- **Sales Transaction:** A customer purchases goods worth $200. The business collects $26 in HST, for a total of $226.

- **Journal Entry:**

  ```
  Debit: Cash/Accounts Receivable $226
  Credit: Sales Revenue $200
  Credit: Sales Tax Payable $26
  ```

- **Remittance:** At the end of the month, the business remits the collected HST to the CRA.

  ```
  Debit: Sales Tax Payable $26
  Credit: Cash $26
  ```

#### Scenario 2: Service Provider in Quebec

A service provider in Quebec charges a 5% GST and a 9.975% QST on services rendered. The business collects sales tax on each service and remits it quarterly to Revenu Québec.

- **Service Transaction:** A client is billed $500 for services. The business collects $25 in GST and $49.88 in QST, for a total of $574.88.

- **Journal Entry:**

  ```
  Debit: Cash/Accounts Receivable $574.88
  Credit: Service Revenue $500
  Credit: GST Payable $25
  Credit: QST Payable $49.88
  ```

- **Remittance:** At the end of the quarter, the business remits the collected GST and QST to Revenu Québec.

  ```
  Debit: GST Payable $25
  Debit: QST Payable $49.88
  Credit: Cash $74.88
  ```
