## 7.3 Recording Purchases of Merchandise

Purchasing merchandise is a fundamental activity for businesses involved in selling goods. Understanding how to accurately record these transactions is crucial for maintaining accurate financial records and preparing financial statements. This section will guide you through the process of recording purchases of merchandise, emphasizing key concepts, practical examples, and compliance with Canadian accounting standards.

### Understanding Merchandise Purchases

Merchandise purchases refer to the acquisition of goods that a company intends to sell to its customers. These transactions are a critical component of the accounting cycle for merchandising businesses. Properly recording these purchases ensures that the cost of goods sold (COGS) and inventory levels are accurately reflected in the financial statements.

### Accounting for Merchandise Purchases

In accounting, merchandise purchases are recorded using the double-entry bookkeeping system. This involves making entries in both the inventory and accounts payable accounts. The primary goal is to ensure that the financial statements accurately reflect the cost of inventory and the company's obligations to suppliers.

#### Key Accounts Involved

1. **Inventory Account**: Represents the cost of goods available for sale. It is an asset account that increases with purchases and decreases with sales.
2. **Accounts Payable Account**: Represents the amount owed to suppliers for goods purchased on credit. It is a liability account that increases with purchases and decreases with payments.

### The Purchase Process

The purchase process typically involves several steps, including placing an order, receiving goods, and making payment. Each step has specific accounting implications:

1. **Placing an Order**: When a company places an order with a supplier, no accounting entry is made. The transaction is recorded only when the goods are received.

2. **Receiving Goods**: Upon receiving goods, the company records the purchase in the inventory account and the accounts payable account. This entry reflects the increase in inventory and the corresponding liability to the supplier.

3. **Making Payment**: When the company pays the supplier, the accounts payable account is debited, and the cash or bank account is credited.

### Recording Purchases: Perpetual vs. Periodic Inventory Systems

There are two primary inventory systems used to record purchases: the perpetual inventory system and the periodic inventory system. Each system has its own method for tracking inventory and recording purchases.

#### Perpetual Inventory System

In a perpetual inventory system, inventory records are updated continuously as transactions occur. This system provides real-time information about inventory levels and cost of goods sold.

**Example:**

A company purchases $5,000 worth of merchandise on credit. The journal entry would be:

```
Inventory                  5,000
   Accounts Payable           5,000
```

This entry increases the inventory account and the accounts payable account by $5,000.

#### Periodic Inventory System

In a periodic inventory system, inventory records are updated at the end of an accounting period. Purchases are recorded in a temporary account, and the cost of goods sold is calculated at the end of the period.

**Example:**

A company purchases $5,000 worth of merchandise on credit. The journal entry would be:

```
Purchases                  5,000
   Accounts Payable           5,000
```

At the end of the period, the purchases account is closed, and the inventory and cost of goods sold are adjusted accordingly.

### Discounts and Returns

Merchandise purchases may involve discounts and returns, which must be accurately recorded to reflect the true cost of inventory.

#### Purchase Discounts

Suppliers often offer discounts for early payment. These discounts are recorded as a reduction in the cost of inventory.

**Example:**

A company purchases $5,000 worth of merchandise with terms 2/10, n/30. If the company pays within 10 days, it receives a 2% discount.

```
Accounts Payable         5,000
   Inventory                  100
   Cash                       4,900
```

#### Purchase Returns and Allowances

If merchandise is returned or an allowance is granted, the inventory and accounts payable accounts must be adjusted.

**Example:**

A company returns $1,000 worth of defective merchandise.

```
Accounts Payable         1,000
   Inventory                  1,000
```

### Practical Example: Recording Purchases in a Canadian Context

Consider a Canadian company, Maple Leaf Retailers, that purchases merchandise from a supplier. The company uses the perpetual inventory system and records the following transactions:

1. **Purchase of Merchandise**: Maple Leaf Retailers purchases $10,000 worth of merchandise on credit.

```
Inventory                 10,000
   Accounts Payable          10,000
```

2. **Payment with Discount**: The company pays the supplier within the discount period, receiving a 2% discount.

```
Accounts Payable         10,000
   Inventory                  200
   Cash                       9,800
```

3. **Return of Merchandise**: Maple Leaf Retailers returns $2,000 worth of merchandise due to defects.

```
Accounts Payable         2,000
   Inventory                  2,000
```

### Compliance with Canadian Accounting Standards

In Canada, companies must comply with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) or Accounting Standards for Private Enterprises (ASPE) when recording merchandise purchases. These standards provide guidelines for recognizing and measuring inventory and related transactions.

#### IFRS and ASPE Guidelines

- **IFRS**: Under IFRS, inventory is measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Purchase discounts are deducted from the cost of inventory.
- **ASPE**: Similar to IFRS, ASPE requires inventory to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Purchase discounts are also deducted from the cost of inventory.

### Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

Recording merchandise purchases can be complex, and there are common pitfalls to avoid:

- **Incorrectly Recording Discounts**: Ensure that purchase discounts are recorded as a reduction in inventory cost, not as income.
- **Failing to Record Returns**: Always adjust inventory and accounts payable for returns and allowances to reflect the true cost of inventory.
- **Misclassifying Inventory Costs**: Include all costs necessary to bring inventory to its present location and condition, such as transportation and handling costs.

**Best Practices:**

- **Use a Consistent Inventory System**: Choose between perpetual and periodic inventory systems based on your business needs and ensure consistent application.
- **Regularly Reconcile Inventory Records**: Perform regular reconciliations to ensure that inventory records match physical counts.
- **Stay Informed of Accounting Standards**: Keep up-to-date with changes in IFRS and ASPE to ensure compliance.

### Real-World Applications

In practice, recording purchases of merchandise involves collaboration between various departments, including purchasing, accounting, and inventory management. Effective communication and accurate record-keeping are essential for maintaining accurate financial statements and making informed business decisions.

### Conclusion

Recording purchases of merchandise is a fundamental aspect of accounting for merchandising operations. By understanding the process and complying with Canadian accounting standards, you can ensure accurate financial reporting and effective inventory management. Practice recording transactions, familiarize yourself with the relevant standards, and apply best practices to excel in your accounting exams and professional career.
