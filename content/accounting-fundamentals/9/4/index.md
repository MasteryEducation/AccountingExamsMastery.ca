## 9.4 Control over Cash Disbursements

Cash disbursements are a critical aspect of any business's financial operations, involving the outflow of cash to settle obligations. Effective control over cash disbursements is essential to ensure accuracy, prevent fraud, and maintain compliance with accounting standards. This section provides a comprehensive guide to understanding and implementing robust controls over cash disbursements, tailored to the Canadian accounting environment.

### Understanding Cash Disbursements

Cash disbursements refer to the payments made by a business to settle its financial obligations. These can include payments for goods and services, employee salaries, tax liabilities, and other operational expenses. The primary goal of controlling cash disbursements is to ensure that all payments are authorized, accurate, and recorded correctly in the financial statements.

### Importance of Controlling Cash Disbursements

1. **Fraud Prevention:** Implementing strong controls helps prevent fraudulent activities such as unauthorized payments or embezzlement.
2. **Accuracy:** Ensures that all disbursements are recorded accurately, reflecting the true financial position of the business.
3. **Compliance:** Helps maintain compliance with Canadian accounting standards and regulations, such as IFRS and ASPE.
4. **Cash Flow Management:** Effective control over disbursements aids in managing cash flow, ensuring that the business has sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations.

### Key Components of Cash Disbursement Controls

1. **Authorization and Approval:** All disbursements should be authorized by a responsible individual, typically a manager or financial officer, to ensure legitimacy.
2. **Segregation of Duties:** Separate responsibilities among different individuals to reduce the risk of errors and fraud. For example, the person authorizing payments should not be the same person who processes them.
3. **Documentation and Record Keeping:** Maintain detailed records of all disbursements, including invoices, receipts, and payment authorizations.
4. **Reconciliation:** Regularly reconcile bank statements with accounting records to identify discrepancies and ensure accuracy.
5. **Physical Security:** Secure access to cash and financial records to prevent unauthorized access and theft.

### Procedures for Controlling Cash Disbursements

#### 1. Establishing a Payment Process

- **Vendor Verification:** Verify the legitimacy of vendors before making payments. This includes checking business credentials and ensuring that the vendor is approved in the system.
- **Purchase Orders:** Use purchase orders to document and authorize purchases before payment is made. This ensures that all disbursements are pre-approved and align with business needs.
- **Invoice Matching:** Match invoices with purchase orders and receiving reports to verify that goods or services were received as ordered before processing payment.

#### 2. Payment Authorization

- **Approval Hierarchy:** Implement an approval hierarchy where payments above a certain threshold require additional authorization from senior management.
- **Dual Signatures:** For checks and electronic payments, require dual signatures or approvals to ensure that no single individual has complete control over disbursements.

#### 3. Payment Methods

- **Checks:** Use pre-numbered checks to maintain a record of all payments. Ensure that checks are signed by authorized personnel only.
- **Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT):** Utilize EFT for secure and efficient payments. Implement controls such as encryption and authentication to protect against unauthorized transactions.
- **Petty Cash:** Limit the use of petty cash for small, incidental expenses. Establish a petty cash fund with a fixed amount and require receipts for all expenditures.

#### 4. Record Keeping and Documentation

- **Maintain Records:** Keep detailed records of all disbursements, including the date, amount, payee, and purpose of the payment.
- **Audit Trail:** Ensure that all transactions have a clear audit trail, allowing for easy tracing and verification of payments.
- **Document Retention:** Follow Canadian regulations for document retention, keeping records for the required period to comply with tax and audit requirements.

#### 5. Reconciliation and Monitoring

- **Bank Reconciliation:** Perform regular bank reconciliations to compare the company’s records with bank statements, identifying any discrepancies or unauthorized transactions.
- **Internal Audits:** Conduct periodic internal audits to review cash disbursement processes and identify areas for improvement.
- **Monitoring Systems:** Use accounting software with built-in monitoring and alert systems to detect unusual transactions or patterns that may indicate fraud.

### Practical Examples and Scenarios

#### Case Study: Implementing Dual Authorization

A mid-sized Canadian manufacturing company faced issues with unauthorized payments due to a lack of oversight in their cash disbursement process. By implementing a dual authorization system, where both the CFO and the department head must approve payments over $10,000, the company significantly reduced the risk of fraudulent transactions. This change not only improved financial security but also increased accountability among staff.

#### Scenario: Reconciling Discrepancies

During a routine bank reconciliation, an accountant at a retail company discovered a discrepancy between the recorded disbursements and the bank statement. Upon investigation, it was found that a payment had been recorded twice in the accounting system. By promptly identifying and correcting this error, the company avoided potential financial misstatements and ensured accurate financial reporting.

### Real-World Applications and Regulatory Scenarios

In Canada, businesses must adhere to various accounting standards and regulations when managing cash disbursements. The following are some key considerations:

- **IFRS and ASPE Compliance:** Ensure that cash disbursement processes comply with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Accounting Standards for Private Enterprises (ASPE) as applicable.
- **CPA Canada Guidelines:** Follow guidelines from CPA Canada, which provide best practices for financial management and internal controls.
- **Tax Compliance:** Maintain accurate records of all disbursements to comply with Canadian tax laws and facilitate tax reporting.

### Step-by-Step Guidance for Implementing Controls

1. **Assess Current Procedures:** Evaluate existing cash disbursement processes to identify weaknesses or areas lacking control.
2. **Develop a Control Plan:** Create a comprehensive plan outlining the controls to be implemented, including authorization procedures, documentation requirements, and reconciliation processes.
3. **Train Staff:** Provide training for all employees involved in cash disbursements to ensure they understand the importance of controls and how to implement them effectively.
4. **Implement Controls:** Roll out the new controls, ensuring that all staff adhere to the established procedures.
5. **Monitor and Review:** Continuously monitor the effectiveness of the controls and make adjustments as necessary to address any emerging risks or issues.

### Best Practices, Common Pitfalls, and Strategies

#### Best Practices

- **Regular Training:** Conduct regular training sessions for staff to keep them informed about the latest fraud prevention techniques and control measures.
- **Use Technology:** Leverage technology such as accounting software and secure payment platforms to enhance control over cash disbursements.
- **Segregate Duties:** Ensure that no single individual has control over all aspects of cash disbursements to reduce the risk of fraud.

#### Common Pitfalls

- **Lack of Documentation:** Failing to maintain proper documentation can lead to errors and make it difficult to trace transactions.
- **Inadequate Authorization:** Allowing payments without proper authorization increases the risk of unauthorized disbursements.
- **Neglecting Reconciliation:** Skipping regular reconciliations can result in undetected discrepancies and financial misstatements.

#### Strategies to Overcome Challenges

- **Implement Checklists:** Use checklists to ensure that all necessary steps are followed in the disbursement process.
- **Conduct Surprise Audits:** Perform unannounced audits to assess the effectiveness of controls and identify any weaknesses.
- **Encourage Reporting:** Foster a culture where employees feel comfortable reporting suspicious activities or potential fraud.
