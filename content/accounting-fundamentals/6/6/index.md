## 6.6 Post-Closing Trial Balance

The post-closing trial balance is a crucial step in the accounting cycle, ensuring that all temporary accounts have been closed and that the ledger is balanced before the new accounting period begins. This process is vital for maintaining accurate financial records and providing a clear picture of a company's financial position. In this section, we will explore the purpose, preparation, and significance of the post-closing trial balance, along with practical examples and insights into its application in the Canadian accounting context.

### Understanding the Post-Closing Trial Balance

The post-closing trial balance is a list of all permanent accounts and their balances after closing entries have been made. It serves as a final check to ensure that the ledger is balanced and that all temporary accounts, such as revenues, expenses, and dividends, have been closed to the retained earnings account. This step is essential for preparing accurate financial statements and ensuring that the accounting records are ready for the next accounting period.

### Practical Example of a Post-Closing Trial Balance

**Permanent Accounts and Balances:**

| Account                  | Debit ($) | Credit ($) |
|--------------------------|-----------|------------|
| Cash                     | 10,000    |            |
| Accounts Receivable      | 5,000     |            |
| Inventory                | 8,000     |            |
| Equipment                | 20,000    |            |
| Accumulated Depreciation |           | 5,000      |
| Accounts Payable         |           | 3,000      |
| Notes Payable            |           | 7,000      |
| Retained Earnings        |           | 28,000     |

**Post-Closing Trial Balance:**

| Account                  | Debit ($) | Credit ($) |
|--------------------------|-----------|------------|
| Cash                     | 10,000    |            |
| Accounts Receivable      | 5,000     |            |
| Inventory                | 8,000     |            |
| Equipment                | 20,000    |            |
| Accumulated Depreciation |           | 5,000      |
| Accounts Payable         |           | 3,000      |
| Notes Payable            |           | 7,000      |
| Retained Earnings        |           | 28,000     |
| **Total**                | **43,000**| **43,000** |

In this example, the total debits equal the total credits, indicating that the ledger is balanced and the post-closing trial balance is accurate.
