## 11.5 Asset Impairment

Asset impairment is a critical concept in accounting that ensures the accurate representation of an entity's financial position. It involves recognizing and measuring the decline in the recoverable amount of an asset below its carrying amount. This section will guide you through the principles, processes, and implications of asset impairment, focusing on Canadian accounting standards and practices.

### Understanding Asset Impairment

Asset impairment occurs when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Recognizing impairment is essential to prevent overstating assets on the balance sheet, which could mislead stakeholders about the financial health of an organization.

#### Key Concepts

- **Carrying Amount**: The amount at which an asset is recognized on the balance sheet after deducting accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
- **Recoverable Amount**: The higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
- **Fair Value Less Costs to Sell**: The price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, minus the costs of disposal.
- **Value in Use**: The present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or cash-generating unit (CGU).

### Recognizing Asset Impairment

The process of recognizing asset impairment involves several steps, which are guided by accounting standards such as the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the Accounting Standards for Private Enterprises (ASPE) in Canada.

#### Indicators of Impairment

An entity must assess at each reporting date whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. Indicators of impairment can be external or internal:

- **External Indicators**:
  - Significant decline in market value.
  - Adverse changes in the technological, market, economic, or legal environment.
  - Increases in market interest rates affecting the discount rate used in calculating value in use.
  - The carrying amount of the net assets of the entity is more than its market capitalization.

- **Internal Indicators**:
  - Obsolescence or physical damage.
  - Changes in the way an asset is used or expected to be used.
  - Evidence from internal reporting indicating that the economic performance of an asset is, or will be, worse than expected.

#### Impairment Testing

When there is an indication of impairment, an entity must estimate the recoverable amount of the asset. If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss must be recognized.

##### Steps in Impairment Testing

1. **Identify the Asset or CGU**: Determine whether the impairment test should be conducted on an individual asset or a cash-generating unit (CGU). A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows largely independent of other assets or groups.

2. **Determine the Recoverable Amount**: Calculate the recoverable amount as the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.

3. **Compare Carrying Amount and Recoverable Amount**: If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, recognize an impairment loss.

4. **Recognize and Measure Impairment Loss**: The impairment loss is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. This loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss.

### Measuring Asset Impairment

The measurement of asset impairment involves determining the recoverable amount and comparing it to the carrying amount. This process requires careful consideration of various factors and assumptions.

#### Fair Value Less Costs to Sell

Fair value less costs to sell is determined based on the best available information, such as market prices or recent transactions for similar assets. Costs to sell include incremental costs directly attributable to the disposal of the asset, excluding finance costs and income tax expense.

#### Value in Use

Calculating value in use involves estimating future cash flows from the asset and discounting them to their present value. Key considerations include:

- **Cash Flow Projections**: Based on reasonable and supportable assumptions, reflecting management's best estimate of the economic conditions that will exist over the asset's remaining useful life.
- **Discount Rate**: Reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. The rate should be pre-tax and exclude risks already reflected in the cash flow estimates.

### Reporting and Disclosure

Once an impairment loss is recognized, it must be reported in the financial statements. Disclosure requirements under IFRS and ASPE include:

- The amount of impairment losses recognized in profit or loss during the period.
- The events and circumstances leading to the recognition of the impairment loss.
- The nature of the asset or CGU impaired.
- The method used to determine the recoverable amount.

### Practical Examples and Scenarios

To illustrate the application of asset impairment, consider the following examples:

#### Example 1: Impairment of a Manufacturing Plant

A manufacturing company identifies a significant decline in the market value of its plant due to technological advancements in the industry. The carrying amount of the plant is $5 million. The company estimates the fair value less costs to sell at $3 million and the value in use at $3.5 million. Since the recoverable amount ($3.5 million) is less than the carrying amount, the company recognizes an impairment loss of $1.5 million.

#### Example 2: Impairment of Goodwill

A retail chain acquires a competitor and recognizes goodwill of $2 million. Due to a downturn in the retail market, the company performs an impairment test and determines that the recoverable amount of the CGU, including goodwill, is $8 million, while the carrying amount is $9 million. The company recognizes an impairment loss of $1 million on goodwill.

### Challenges and Best Practices

Asset impairment involves significant judgment and estimation, which can lead to challenges in practice. Common challenges include:

- **Estimating Future Cash Flows**: Requires accurate forecasting and consideration of various economic factors.
- **Determining Discount Rates**: Involves assessing market conditions and the specific risks associated with the asset.
- **Identifying CGUs**: Requires careful analysis of how assets generate cash inflows.

#### Best Practices

- **Regular Monitoring**: Continuously monitor indicators of impairment to ensure timely recognition.
- **Robust Documentation**: Maintain detailed documentation of assumptions and calculations used in impairment testing.
- **Independent Review**: Consider obtaining an independent review of impairment calculations to enhance reliability.

### Regulatory Considerations

In Canada, asset impairment is governed by IFRS for publicly accountable enterprises and ASPE for private enterprises. Key standards include:

- **IFRS 36 - Impairment of Assets**: Provides guidance on identifying, measuring, and recognizing impairment losses.
- **ASPE Section 3063 - Impairment of Long-Lived Assets**: Offers similar guidance for private enterprises, with some differences in application.

### Conclusion

Understanding and applying asset impairment principles is crucial for accurate financial reporting and compliance with Canadian accounting standards. By recognizing and measuring impairment losses, entities can provide a true and fair view of their financial position, enhancing transparency and trust among stakeholders.
