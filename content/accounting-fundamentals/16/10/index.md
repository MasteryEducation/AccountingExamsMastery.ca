4. **Master Budget**: A comprehensive financial plan that consolidates all individual budgets, providing an overview of the organization's financial position.

### Strategic Planning and Long-Term Budgeting

Strategic planning and long-term budgeting are integral components of managerial accounting, enabling organizations to align their financial resources with long-term objectives.

#### Strategic Planning

Strategic planning involves defining the organization's vision, mission, and long-term goals. It provides a roadmap for achieving these objectives, guiding decision-making and resource allocation.

#### Long-Term Budgeting

Long-term budgeting extends beyond the typical one-year budget cycle, focusing on financial planning over multiple years. It involves:

- **Forecasting**: Projecting future financial performance based on historical data, market trends, and economic conditions.
