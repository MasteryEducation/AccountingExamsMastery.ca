### Horizontal Analysis

Horizontal analysis involves comparing financial data over a period to identify trends and growth patterns. Let's analyze the income statement and balance sheet of Maple Leaf Enterprises using horizontal analysis.

#### Income Statement Horizontal Analysis

To perform horizontal analysis, calculate the percentage change for each line item from 2022 to 2023.

- **Revenue Growth**: 
  {{< katex >}}
  \text{Revenue Growth} = \frac{\text{2023 Revenue} - \text{2022 Revenue}}{\text{2022 Revenue}} \times 100 = \frac{5,000,000 - 4,500,000}{4,500,000} \times 100 = 11.11\%
  {{< /katex >}}

- **COGS Growth**: 
  {{< katex >}}
  \text{COGS Growth} = \frac{3,000,000 - 2,700,000}{2,700,000} \times 100 = 11.11\%
  {{< /katex >}}

- **Net Income Growth**: 
  {{< katex >}}
  \text{Net Income Growth} = \frac{525,000 - 458,500}{458,500} \times 100 = 14.50\%
  {{< /katex >}}

The analysis reveals that Maple Leaf Enterprises experienced a healthy growth in revenue and net income, indicating effective cost management and increased sales.

#### Balance Sheet Horizontal Analysis

- **Total Assets Growth**: 
  {{< katex >}}
  \text{Total Assets Growth} = \frac{4,000,000 - 3,500,000}{3,500,000} \times 100 = 14.29\%
  {{< /katex >}}

- **Total Liabilities Growth**: 
  {{< katex >}}
  \text{Total Liabilities Growth} = \frac{2,000,000 - 1,800,000}{1,800,000} \times 100 = 11.11\%
  {{< /katex >}}

- **Shareholder's Equity Growth**: 
  {{< katex >}}
  \text{Equity Growth} = \frac{2,000,000 - 1,700,000}{1,700,000} \times 100 = 17.65\%
  {{< /katex >}}

The growth in assets and equity outpaces the growth in liabilities, suggesting a strong financial position and potential for future expansion.

### Vertical Analysis

Vertical analysis involves expressing each line item as a percentage of a base figure within the same financial statement. This method helps in understanding the relative size of each component.

#### Income Statement Vertical Analysis

For the income statement, express each item as a percentage of total revenue.

- **Gross Profit Margin**: 
  {{< katex >}}
  \text{Gross Profit Margin} = \frac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Revenue}} \times 100 = \frac{2,000,000}{5,000,000} \times 100 = 40\%
  {{< /katex >}}

- **Operating Income Margin**: 
  {{< katex >}}
  \text{Operating Income Margin} = \frac{\text{Operating Income}}{\text{Revenue}} \times 100 = \frac{800,000}{5,000,000} \times 100 = 16\%
  {{< /katex >}}

- **Net Income Margin**: 
  {{< katex >}}
  \text{Net Income Margin} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Revenue}} \times 100 = \frac{525,000}{5,000,000} \times 100 = 10.5\%
  {{< /katex >}}

These margins indicate the efficiency of Maple Leaf Enterprises in converting sales into profit.

#### Balance Sheet Vertical Analysis

For the balance sheet, express each item as a percentage of total assets.

- **Current Assets Percentage**: 
  {{< katex >}}
  \text{Current Assets Percentage} = \frac{1,500,000}{4,000,000} \times 100 = 37.5\%
  {{< /katex >}}

- **Current Liabilities Percentage**: 
  {{< katex >}}
  \text{Current Liabilities Percentage} = \frac{800,000}{4,000,000} \times 100 = 20\%
  {{< /katex >}}

- **Equity Percentage**: 
  {{< katex >}}
  \text{Equity Percentage} = \frac{2,000,000}{4,000,000} \times 100 = 50\%
  {{< /katex >}}

The analysis shows a balanced asset structure and a strong equity position, which is favorable for creditors and investors.

### Ratio Analysis

Ratio analysis provides insights into various aspects of a company's performance, including liquidity, solvency, and profitability. Let's calculate and interpret key financial ratios for Maple Leaf Enterprises.

#### Liquidity Ratios

- **Current Ratio**: 
  {{< katex >}}
  \text{Current Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{Current Liabilities}} = \frac{1,500,000}{800,000} = 1.875
  {{< /katex >}}

- **Quick Ratio**: 
  {{< katex >}}
  \text{Quick Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets} - \text{Inventory}}{\text{Current Liabilities}} = \frac{1,500,000 - 500,000}{800,000} = 1.25
  {{< /katex >}}

These ratios indicate that Maple Leaf Enterprises has a strong liquidity position, able to meet short-term obligations.

#### Solvency Ratios

- **Debt to Equity Ratio**: 
  {{< katex >}}
  \text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Liabilities}}{\text{Shareholder's Equity}} = \frac{2,000,000}{2,000,000} = 1
  {{< /katex >}}

- **Interest Coverage Ratio**: 
  {{< katex >}}
  \text{Interest Coverage Ratio} = \frac{\text{Operating Income}}{\text{Interest Expense}} = \frac{800,000}{50,000} = 16
  {{< /katex >}}

The solvency ratios suggest that the company is well-positioned to cover its long-term obligations and interest expenses.

#### Profitability Ratios

- **Return on Assets (ROA)**: 
  {{< katex >}}
  \text{ROA} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Total Assets}} \times 100 = \frac{525,000}{4,000,000} \times 100 = 13.13\%
  {{< /katex >}}

- **Return on Equity (ROE)**: 
  {{< katex >}}
  \text{ROE} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Shareholder's Equity}} \times 100 = \frac{525,000}{2,000,000} \times 100 = 26.25\%
  {{< /katex >}}

These profitability ratios highlight the company's ability to generate returns on its assets and equity, indicating strong financial performance.
