## 18.8 Financial Ratios Glossary

Financial ratios are essential tools for analyzing a company's financial health and performance. They provide insights into various aspects of a business, such as liquidity, profitability, efficiency, and solvency. Understanding these ratios is crucial for anyone preparing for Canadian accounting exams, as they are frequently tested and widely used in professional practice. This section offers a comprehensive glossary of key financial ratios, complete with definitions, formulas, practical examples, and real-world applications.

### 1. Liquidity Ratios

Liquidity ratios measure a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations using its most liquid assets. These ratios are vital for assessing the financial stability of a business in the short term.

#### 1.1 Current Ratio

**Definition:** The current ratio indicates the ability of a company to pay its short-term liabilities with its short-term assets.

**Formula:**

{{< katex >}}
\text{Current Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}
{{< /katex >}}

**Example:** If a company has current assets of $150,000 and current liabilities of $100,000, the current ratio is 1.5. This means the company has $1.50 in current assets for every $1.00 of current liabilities.

#### 1.2 Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)

**Definition:** The quick ratio measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets, excluding inventory.

**Formula:**

{{< katex >}}
\text{Quick Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets} - \text{Inventory}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}
{{< /katex >}}

**Example:** With current assets of $150,000, inventory of $50,000, and current liabilities of $100,000, the quick ratio is 1.0, indicating the company can cover its liabilities without relying on inventory sales.

#### 1.3 Cash Ratio

**Definition:** The cash ratio assesses a company's ability to pay off its short-term liabilities with cash and cash equivalents.

**Formula:**

{{< katex >}}
\text{Cash Ratio} = \frac{\text{Cash and Cash Equivalents}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}
{{< /katex >}}

**Example:** If a company holds $30,000 in cash and cash equivalents and has $100,000 in current liabilities, the cash ratio is 0.3, suggesting limited liquidity.

### 2. Profitability Ratios

Profitability ratios evaluate a company's ability to generate profit relative to its revenue, assets, equity, and other financial metrics.

#### 2.1 Gross Profit Margin

**Definition:** The gross profit margin indicates the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS).

**Formula:**

{{< katex >}}
\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \frac{\text{Revenue} - \text{COGS}}{\text{Revenue}} \times 100
{{< /katex >}}

**Example:** With revenue of $200,000 and COGS of $120,000, the gross profit margin is 40%, showing that 40% of revenue is retained as gross profit.

#### 2.2 Operating Profit Margin

**Definition:** The operating profit margin measures the percentage of revenue remaining after covering operating expenses.

**Formula:**

{{< katex >}}
\text{Operating Profit Margin} = \frac{\text{Operating Income}}{\text{Revenue}} \times 100
{{< /katex >}}

**Example:** If operating income is $50,000 and revenue is $200,000, the operating profit margin is 25%, indicating efficient management of operating costs.

#### 2.3 Net Profit Margin

**Definition:** The net profit margin shows the percentage of revenue left after all expenses, taxes, and interest are deducted.

**Formula:**

{{< katex >}}
\text{Net Profit Margin} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Revenue}} \times 100

{{< /katex >}}

**Example:** If net income is $30,000 and total assets are $300,000, the ROA is 10%, indicating effective asset utilization.

#### 2.5 Return on Equity (ROE)

**Definition:** ROE assesses a company's ability to generate profit from shareholders' equity.

**Formula:**

\text{ROE} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Shareholders' Equity}} \times 100
{{< /katex >}}

**Example:** With net income of $30,000 and shareholders' equity of $200,000, the ROE is 15%, demonstrating strong returns for investors.

### 3. Efficiency Ratios

Efficiency ratios evaluate how well a company utilizes its assets and liabilities to generate sales and maximize profits.

#### 3.1 Asset Turnover Ratio

**Definition:** The asset turnover ratio measures a company's ability to generate sales from its assets.

\text{Asset Turnover Ratio} = \frac{\text{Net Sales}}{\text{Average Total Assets}}
{{< /katex >}}

**Example:** With net sales of $500,000 and average total assets of $250,000, the asset turnover ratio is 2.0, indicating efficient asset use.

#### 3.2 Inventory Turnover Ratio

**Definition:** This ratio shows how often a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period.

**Formula:**

{{< katex >}}
\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \frac{\text{COGS}}{\text{Average Inventory}}
{{< /katex >}}

**Example:** If COGS is $120,000 and average inventory is $30,000, the inventory turnover ratio is 4.0, suggesting effective inventory management.

#### 3.3 Receivables Turnover Ratio

**Definition:** The receivables turnover ratio measures how effectively a company collects its accounts receivable.

**Formula:**

{{< katex >}}
\text{Receivables Turnover Ratio} = \frac{\text{Net Credit Sales}}{\text{Average Accounts Receivable}}
{{< /katex >}}

**Example:** With net credit sales of $200,000 and average accounts receivable of $25,000, the ratio is 8.0, indicating efficient credit management.

**Formula:**

{{< katex >}}
\text{Interest Coverage Ratio} = \frac{\text{EBIT}}{\text{Interest Expense}}
{{< /katex >}}

**Example:** If EBIT is $60,000 and interest expense is $10,000, the interest coverage ratio is 6.0, indicating strong interest payment capacity.

**Formula:**

{{< katex >}}
\text{EPS} = \frac{\text{Net Income} - \text{Preferred Dividends}}{\text{Average Outstanding Shares}}

**Example:** With net income of $50,000, preferred dividends of $5,000, and 10,000 average outstanding shares, EPS is $4.50.

#### 5.2 Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio)

**Definition:** The P/E ratio compares a company's share price to its earnings per share, indicating market expectations.

**Formula:**

{{< katex >}}
\text{P/E Ratio} = \frac{\text{Market Price per Share}}{\text{Earnings Per Share}}
{{< /katex >}}

**Example:** If the market price per share is $90 and EPS is $4.50, the P/E ratio is 20, suggesting investor optimism.

#### 5.3 Dividend Yield

**Definition:** The dividend yield measures the annual dividend income relative to the share price.

**Formula:**

{{< katex >}}
\text{Dividend Yield} = \frac{\text{Annual Dividends per Share}}{\text{Market Price per Share}} \times 100
