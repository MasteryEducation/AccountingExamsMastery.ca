## 18.5 Key Accounting Terms Q - T

In the world of accounting, understanding key terms is essential for both academic success and professional practice. This section of the guide focuses on accounting terms starting with the letters Q through T, providing detailed definitions, practical examples, and real-world applications relevant to the Canadian accounting environment. Whether you're preparing for Canadian accounting exams or enhancing your professional knowledge, this comprehensive glossary will serve as a valuable resource.

### **Q**

#### **Qualified Opinion**
A qualified opinion is a statement issued by an auditor indicating that, except for certain issues, the financial statements are fairly presented. This opinion suggests that the financial statements are mostly in compliance with accounting standards, but there are specific areas that deviate from the norm.

**Example:** An auditor may issue a qualified opinion if they find that inventory valuation methods do not comply with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) but the rest of the financial statements are accurate.

#### **Quick Ratio**
The quick ratio, also known as the acid-test ratio, measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. It is calculated by dividing liquid assets (cash, marketable securities, and receivables) by current liabilities.

**Formula:** Quick Ratio = (Cash + Marketable Securities + Receivables) / Current Liabilities

**Example:** A company with $50,000 in cash, $20,000 in receivables, and $30,000 in current liabilities has a quick ratio of 2.33, indicating strong liquidity.

#### **Quasi-Reorganization**
A quasi-reorganization is an accounting process that allows a company to eliminate a deficit in retained earnings without undergoing a legal reorganization. This process involves revaluing assets and liabilities to reflect their fair value and adjusting the equity section of the balance sheet.

**Application:** Companies use quasi-reorganizations to improve their financial position and attract investors by presenting a healthier balance sheet.

### **R**

#### **Receivables Turnover Ratio**
The receivables turnover ratio measures how efficiently a company collects its accounts receivable. It is calculated by dividing net credit sales by the average accounts receivable.

**Formula:** Receivables Turnover Ratio = Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable

**Example:** A company with $500,000 in net credit sales and an average accounts receivable of $50,000 has a receivables turnover ratio of 10, indicating efficient collection practices.

#### **Residual Value**
Residual value is the estimated value of an asset at the end of its useful life. It is used in calculating depreciation and is important for determining the total cost of ownership.

**Example:** A company purchases equipment for $100,000 with an estimated residual value of $10,000 after 10 years. The residual value is used to calculate depreciation expenses over the asset's life.

#### **Return on Equity (ROE)**
Return on Equity measures a company's profitability by revealing how much profit a company generates with the money shareholders have invested. It is calculated by dividing net income by shareholder's equity.

**Formula:** ROE = Net Income / Shareholder's Equity

**Example:** A company with a net income of $200,000 and shareholder's equity of $1,000,000 has an ROE of 20%, indicating efficient use of equity.

#### **Revenue Recognition Principle**
The revenue recognition principle dictates that revenue should be recognized when it is earned and realizable, regardless of when cash is received. This principle is fundamental in accrual accounting.

**Application:** A software company recognizes revenue when a service is delivered, even if payment is received later, aligning with the IFRS and ASPE standards.

### **S**

#### **Sales Discount**
A sales discount is a reduction in the price of a product or service offered to customers as an incentive for early payment. It is recorded as a deduction from gross sales.

**Example:** A company offers a 2% discount for payments made within 10 days. If a customer pays a $1,000 invoice within this period, they pay $980, and the company records a $20 sales discount.

#### **Share Capital**
Share capital refers to the funds raised by a company through the issuance of shares. It represents the equity stake of shareholders in the company.

**Types:** Common stock and preferred stock are the two primary types of share capital.

#### **Straight-Line Depreciation**
Straight-line depreciation is a method of allocating the cost of an asset evenly over its useful life. It is the simplest and most commonly used depreciation method.

**Formula:** Annual Depreciation Expense = (Cost of Asset - Residual Value) / Useful Life

**Example:** An asset costing $10,000 with a residual value of $1,000 and a useful life of 9 years has an annual depreciation expense of $1,000.

#### **Subsidiary**
A subsidiary is a company controlled by another company, known as the parent company. The parent company holds a majority of the subsidiary's voting stock.

**Example:** In Canada, a large corporation may establish subsidiaries to operate in different provinces, each focusing on specific markets or products.

### **T**

#### **Tangible Assets**
Tangible assets are physical assets that can be touched, such as machinery, buildings, and inventory. They are recorded on the balance sheet and depreciated over time.

**Example:** A manufacturing company lists its factory and equipment as tangible assets on its balance sheet.

#### **Trial Balance**
A trial balance is a bookkeeping worksheet listing the balances of all ledgers accounts. It is used to ensure that debits equal credits after posting transactions.

**Purpose:** The trial balance helps identify discrepancies in the accounting records before preparing financial statements.

#### **Treasury Stock**
Treasury stock refers to shares that were once a part of the outstanding shares but were later repurchased by the company. These shares are held in the company's treasury and can be reissued or retired.

**Example:** A corporation buys back 1,000 shares of its stock, reducing the number of shares available in the market.

#### **Tax Expense**
Tax expense is the total amount of taxes owed by a company to the government. It includes income tax, sales tax, and other taxes applicable to the business.

**Calculation:** Tax expense is calculated based on taxable income and applicable tax rates.

### **Practical Applications and Exam Tips**
