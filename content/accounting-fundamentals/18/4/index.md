## 18.4 Key Accounting Terms M - P

In the world of accounting, understanding key terms and concepts is crucial for success, especially when preparing for Canadian accounting exams. This section provides a comprehensive glossary of essential accounting terms from M to P, offering clear definitions, practical examples, and insights into their application in the Canadian accounting context. Whether you're a student or a professional, mastering these terms will enhance your understanding and confidence in navigating the complexities of accounting.

### **M**

#### **Management Accounting**
Management accounting involves preparing financial reports and analysis for internal use by management to make informed business decisions. Unlike financial accounting, which focuses on external reporting, management accounting emphasizes future projections, budgeting, and performance evaluation.

**Example:** A company uses management accounting to analyze the cost-effectiveness of a new project, helping managers decide whether to proceed.

#### **Marginal Cost**
Marginal cost refers to the additional cost incurred when producing one more unit of a product. It is a critical concept in decision-making, pricing strategies, and profit maximization.

**Example:** If producing an additional widget costs $5, the marginal cost is $5.

#### **Market Value**
Market value is the estimated amount for which an asset or liability could be exchanged in a transaction between willing parties. It reflects the current value of an asset in the marketplace.

**Example:** The market value of a company's stock is determined by its current trading price on the stock exchange.

#### **Matching Principle**
The matching principle is an accounting concept that dictates expenses should be recorded in the same period as the revenues they help generate. This principle ensures accurate financial reporting by aligning costs with associated revenues.

**Example:** If a company incurs advertising expenses in December to boost holiday sales, those expenses should be matched with December's sales revenue.

#### **Materiality**
Materiality refers to the significance of financial information in influencing the economic decisions of users. An item is considered material if its omission or misstatement could affect the decisions of stakeholders.

**Example:** A $1,000 error in a multi-million dollar company's financial statements may be deemed immaterial, while the same error in a small business could be material.

#### **Monetary Unit Assumption**
The monetary unit assumption is an accounting principle that assumes all financial transactions are recorded in a stable currency. It provides a consistent basis for measuring and reporting financial performance.

**Example:** A Canadian company records all transactions in Canadian dollars, assuming the currency's purchasing power remains stable over time.

### **N**

#### **Net Income**
Net income, also known as net profit or earnings, is the total revenue minus total expenses, taxes, and costs. It represents the company's profitability over a specific period.

**Example:** If a company's total revenue is $500,000 and total expenses are $400,000, the net income is $100,000.

#### **Net Present Value (NPV)**
Net present value is a financial metric used to evaluate the profitability of an investment. It calculates the present value of future cash flows minus the initial investment cost.

**Example:** A project with a positive NPV indicates that the expected earnings exceed the costs, making it a potentially profitable investment.

#### **Non-Current Assets**
Non-current assets, also known as long-term assets, are resources expected to provide economic benefits beyond one year. They include property, plant, equipment, and intangible assets.

**Example:** A company's office building and machinery are considered non-current assets.

#### **Notes Payable**
Notes payable are written promises to pay a specific amount of money at a future date. They are formalized liabilities often used for financing purposes.

**Example:** A company issues a note payable to a bank for a loan, agreeing to repay the principal plus interest over five years.

#### **Net Realizable Value (NRV)**
Net realizable value is the estimated selling price of an asset minus any costs associated with its sale or disposal. It is used to value inventory and accounts receivable.

**Example:** If inventory can be sold for $10,000 and selling costs are $1,000, the NRV is $9,000.

### **O**

#### **Operating Income**
Operating income, or operating profit, is the profit generated from a company's core business operations, excluding non-operating income and expenses. It reflects the efficiency of a company's operations.

**Example:** A retailer's operating income is calculated by subtracting operating expenses from gross profit.

#### **Operating Lease**
An operating lease is a rental agreement where the lessee uses an asset for a specific period without ownership transfer. It is treated as an operating expense rather than a capital asset.

**Example:** A company leases office equipment under an operating lease, recording lease payments as expenses.

#### **Owner's Equity**
Owner's equity represents the owner's residual interest in the company's assets after deducting liabilities. It is also known as net assets or shareholders' equity.

**Example:** In a sole proprietorship, owner's equity includes the owner's capital contributions and retained earnings.

#### **Overhead Costs**
Overhead costs are indirect expenses related to running a business, such as rent, utilities, and administrative salaries. They are not directly tied to specific products or services.

**Example:** A manufacturing company's overhead costs include factory maintenance and management salaries.

#### **Opportunity Cost**
Opportunity cost is the potential benefit lost when choosing one alternative over another. It is a key concept in decision-making and resource allocation.

**Example:** If a company invests in new equipment instead of expanding its marketing efforts, the opportunity cost is the potential revenue from increased sales.

### **P**

#### **Partnership**
A partnership is a business structure where two or more individuals share ownership, profits, and liabilities. Partnerships are governed by a partnership agreement outlining roles and responsibilities.

**Example:** A law firm operates as a partnership, with each partner contributing capital and sharing profits.

#### **Payroll**
Payroll refers to the total compensation a company pays its employees, including wages, salaries, bonuses, and deductions. It involves calculating and processing employee payments.

**Example:** A company's payroll department ensures employees are paid accurately and on time, accounting for taxes and benefits.

#### **Prepaid Expenses**
Prepaid expenses are payments made in advance for goods or services to be received in the future. They are recorded as assets and expensed over time.

**Example:** A company pays an annual insurance premium upfront, recording it as a prepaid expense and expensing it monthly.

#### **Profit Margin**
Profit margin is a financial ratio that measures the percentage of revenue remaining after all expenses are deducted. It indicates a company's profitability and financial health.

**Example:** A company with a profit margin of 20% retains $0.20 of every dollar earned as profit.

#### **Provision**
A provision is a liability of uncertain timing or amount, recognized when a company expects to incur a future expense. It is recorded based on reasonable estimates.

**Example:** A company sets aside a provision for potential legal settlements, reflecting anticipated costs.

### **Practical Examples and Real-World Applications**

Understanding these key accounting terms is crucial for both academic success and practical application in the Canadian accounting profession. Here are some real-world scenarios where these terms play a vital role:

- **Management Accounting:** A manufacturing firm uses management accounting to optimize production processes, reduce costs, and improve profitability.
- **Net Present Value (NPV):** A real estate developer evaluates potential projects using NPV to determine the most financially viable option.
- **Operating Lease:** A tech startup leases office space through an operating lease, preserving capital for business growth.
