## 18.1 Key Accounting Terms A - D

Understanding key accounting terms is essential for anyone preparing for Canadian accounting exams. This section provides comprehensive definitions and explanations of accounting terms starting with the letters A through D. These terms form the foundation of accounting knowledge and are crucial for both exams and professional practice.

### **A**

#### **Accrual Accounting**

Accrual accounting is a method where revenue and expenses are recorded when they are earned or incurred, regardless of when the cash is actually received or paid. This method provides a more accurate picture of a company's financial position and performance over a specific period.

- **Example:** A company delivers goods in December but receives payment in January. Under accrual accounting, the revenue is recorded in December.

#### **Assets**

Assets are resources owned by a company that have economic value and can provide future benefits. They are classified into current and non-current assets.

- **Current Assets:** Expected to be converted into cash or used within one year (e.g., cash, inventory).
- **Non-Current Assets:** Long-term investments not expected to be converted into cash within a year (e.g., property, equipment).

#### **Amortization**

Amortization refers to the gradual reduction of an intangible asset's value over time. It is similar to depreciation but applies to intangible assets like patents or copyrights.

- **Example:** A company amortizes a patent over its useful life of 10 years.

#### **Accounts Payable**

Accounts payable are short-term liabilities representing amounts a company owes to suppliers for goods and services purchased on credit.

- **Example:** A company receives office supplies and agrees to pay the supplier within 30 days.

#### **Accounts Receivable**

Accounts receivable are amounts owed to a company by customers for goods or services provided on credit. They are considered current assets on the balance sheet.

- **Example:** A customer purchases goods on credit, and the amount owed is recorded as accounts receivable.

#### **Accrued Liabilities**

Accrued liabilities are expenses that have been incurred but not yet paid. They are recorded in the financial statements to reflect the company's obligations.

- **Example:** Salaries payable at the end of the month for work already performed.

#### **Audit**

An audit is an independent examination of financial information to provide assurance that financial statements are accurate and comply with accounting standards.

- **Example:** A public company undergoes an annual audit by an external auditor to verify its financial statements.

### **B**

#### **Balance Sheet**

A balance sheet is a financial statement that provides a snapshot of a company's financial position at a specific point in time. It includes assets, liabilities, and equity.

- **Equation:** Assets = Liabilities + Equity

#### **Bookkeeping**

Bookkeeping involves recording financial transactions systematically. It is the foundation of the accounting process and includes tasks such as recording sales, purchases, receipts, and payments.

- **Example:** A bookkeeper records daily sales transactions in the accounting system.

#### **Budget**

A budget is a financial plan that estimates income and expenses over a specific period. It helps organizations allocate resources and monitor financial performance.

- **Example:** A company prepares an annual budget to plan for expected revenue and expenses.

#### **Bond**

A bond is a fixed-income instrument representing a loan made by an investor to a borrower. Bonds are used by companies, municipalities, and governments to finance projects and operations.

- **Example:** A corporation issues bonds to raise capital for expansion.

#### **Break-Even Point**

The break-even point is the level of sales at which total revenues equal total costs, resulting in neither profit nor loss.

- **Calculation:** Break-Even Point = Fixed Costs / (Selling Price per Unit - Variable Cost per Unit)

#### **Bad Debt**

Bad debt refers to accounts receivable that are unlikely to be collected. Companies estimate bad debts and record them as an expense.

- **Example:** A company writes off a customer's account as bad debt after repeated collection attempts fail.

### **C**

#### **Cash Flow Statement**

A cash flow statement is a financial report that shows the inflows and outflows of cash within a company over a specific period. It is divided into operating, investing, and financing activities.

- **Purpose:** To provide insights into a company's liquidity and financial health.

#### **Capital**

Capital refers to financial assets or resources that a company uses to fund its operations and growth. It includes both equity and debt.

- **Example:** A business raises capital through equity financing by issuing shares.

#### **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**

COGS represents the direct costs of producing goods sold by a company. It includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead.

- **Calculation:** COGS = Beginning Inventory + Purchases - Ending Inventory

#### **Credit**

In accounting, credit refers to an entry on the right side of an account that increases liabilities, equity, or revenue, or decreases assets and expenses.

- **Example:** Recording a sale on credit increases accounts receivable and revenue.

#### **Current Ratio**

The current ratio is a liquidity ratio that measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations with its current assets.

- **Calculation:** Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities

#### **Contingent Liability**

A contingent liability is a potential liability that may occur depending on the outcome of a future event.

- **Example:** A company faces a lawsuit, and the potential financial impact is disclosed as a contingent liability.

### **D**

#### **Depreciation**

Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the cost of a tangible asset over its useful life. It reflects the wear and tear of the asset.

- **Methods:** Straight-line, declining balance, and units of production.

#### **Dividend**

A dividend is a distribution of a portion of a company's earnings to its shareholders. Dividends can be in the form of cash, stock, or property.

- **Example:** A company declares a cash dividend of $1 per share to its shareholders.

#### **Double-Entry Bookkeeping**

Double-entry bookkeeping is an accounting system where every transaction affects at least two accounts, with debits equaling credits.

- **Principle:** For every debit entry, there must be a corresponding credit entry.

#### **Deferred Revenue**

Deferred revenue is money received by a company for goods or services yet to be delivered. It is recorded as a liability until the service is provided.

- **Example:** A software company receives payment for a one-year subscription in advance.

#### **Debt-to-Equity Ratio**

The debt-to-equity ratio is a financial ratio indicating the relative proportion of shareholders' equity and debt used to finance a company's assets.

- **Calculation:** Debt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Shareholders' Equity

#### **Direct Costs**

Direct costs are expenses that can be directly attributed to the production of specific goods or services.

- **Example:** The cost of raw materials used in manufacturing a product.

### **Visual Aids**

To enhance understanding, let's visualize the double-entry bookkeeping concept using a simple diagram:

```mermaid

    A[Transaction] --> B[Debit Account];
    A --> C[Credit Account];
    B --> D[Assets];
