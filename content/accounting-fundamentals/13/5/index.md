## 13.5 Treasury Stock

Treasury stock represents shares that were once a part of the outstanding shares of a company but were later repurchased by the company itself. These shares are not considered when calculating dividends or earnings per share, and they do not have voting rights. Understanding treasury stock is crucial for accounting professionals, as it involves specific accounting treatments and has implications for financial statements.

### **Why Companies Buy Back Shares**

Companies may choose to repurchase their shares for several strategic reasons:

1. **Increase Earnings Per Share (EPS):** By reducing the number of outstanding shares, a company can increase its EPS, making the company appear more profitable on a per-share basis.

2. **Signal Confidence:** A buyback can signal to the market that the company believes its stock is undervalued, indicating management's confidence in the company's future prospects.

3. **Improve Financial Ratios:** Buybacks can enhance financial ratios such as return on equity (ROE) by reducing equity.

4. **Prevent Hostile Takeovers:** By reducing the number of shares available for purchase, a company can make it more difficult for an outside party to acquire a controlling interest.

5. **Utilize Excess Cash:** Companies with excess cash may choose to buy back shares as an alternative to paying dividends, especially if they believe the shares are undervalued.

### **Accounting Treatment of Treasury Stock**

The accounting treatment of treasury stock depends on the method used to record the repurchase. The two primary methods are the **cost method** and the **par value method**.

#### **Cost Method**

Under the cost method, treasury stock is recorded at the cost of repurchase. This method is more commonly used and involves the following steps:

1. **Recording the Purchase:**
   - Debit the Treasury Stock account for the total cost of repurchase.
   - Credit the Cash account for the same amount.

2. **Reissuing Treasury Stock:**
   - If the treasury stock is later reissued at a price higher than the repurchase cost, the difference is credited to a Paid-in Capital from Treasury Stock account.
   - If reissued at a price lower than the repurchase cost, the difference is debited from the Paid-in Capital from Treasury Stock account, and if this account does not have a sufficient balance, the remaining amount is debited from Retained Earnings.

3. **Retirement of Treasury Stock:**
   - If the company decides to retire the treasury stock, the Treasury Stock account is debited, and the Common Stock account is credited for the par value of the shares. Any difference is adjusted through Paid-in Capital or Retained Earnings.

#### **Par Value Method**

Under the par value method, treasury stock is recorded at its par value. This method involves:

1. **Recording the Purchase:**
   - Debit the Treasury Stock account for the par value of the shares.
   - Debit the Paid-in Capital account for the excess of the repurchase price over the par value.
   - Credit the Cash account for the total repurchase cost.

2. **Reissuing Treasury Stock:**
   - If reissued at a price higher than the par value, the excess is credited to Paid-in Capital.
   - If reissued at a price lower than the par value, the difference is debited from Paid-in Capital or Retained Earnings.

3. **Retirement of Treasury Stock:**
   - Similar to the cost method, the Treasury Stock account is debited, and the Common Stock account is credited for the par value of the shares. Any difference is adjusted through Paid-in Capital or Retained Earnings.

### **Impact on Financial Statements**

Treasury stock affects a company's financial statements in several ways:

- **Balance Sheet:** Treasury stock is reported as a contra-equity account, reducing total shareholders' equity.
- **Income Statement:** Treasury stock transactions do not directly affect the income statement, but they can impact EPS calculations.
- **Cash Flow Statement:** The repurchase of shares is reflected as a cash outflow in the financing activities section.

### **Regulatory Considerations**

In Canada, companies must comply with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the Canadian Accounting Standards Board (AcSB). Under IFRS, treasury stock is treated as a deduction from equity, and companies must disclose the nature and purpose of treasury stock transactions in the notes to the financial statements.

### **Practical Examples and Case Studies**

#### **Example 1: Basic Treasury Stock Transaction**

ABC Corp repurchases 1,000 shares of its own stock at $10 per share. The journal entry under the cost method would be:

- Debit Treasury Stock: $10,000
- Credit Cash: $10,000

#### **Example 2: Reissuing Treasury Stock**

ABC Corp later reissues 500 shares at $12 per share. The journal entry would be:

- Debit Cash: $6,000
- Credit Treasury Stock: $5,000
- Credit Paid-in Capital from Treasury Stock: $1,000

#### **Example 3: Retirement of Treasury Stock**

If ABC Corp decides to retire the remaining 500 shares, the journal entry would be:

- Debit Common Stock: $5,000
- Credit Treasury Stock: $5,000

### **Common Pitfalls and Best Practices**

- **Overvaluing Treasury Stock:** Companies should avoid overvaluing treasury stock, as this can lead to misleading financial statements.
- **Insufficient Disclosure:** Ensure comprehensive disclosure of treasury stock transactions in the financial statements.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Stay updated with the latest IFRS and ASPE guidelines to ensure compliance.

### **Conclusion**

Treasury stock is a significant aspect of equity management, with implications for financial statements, regulatory compliance, and corporate strategy. Understanding the accounting treatment and strategic reasons for share buybacks is essential for accounting professionals, especially those preparing for Canadian accounting exams.
