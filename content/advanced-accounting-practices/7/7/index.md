## 7.7 Disclosure Requirements for Leases

Lease accounting has undergone significant changes with the introduction of IFRS 16 and ASC 842, which have brought about comprehensive disclosure requirements. These standards aim to enhance transparency by ensuring that financial statements provide a faithful representation of lease transactions. Understanding these disclosure requirements is crucial for accounting professionals and students preparing for Canadian accounting exams. This guide will delve into the specifics of lease disclosures, focusing on both lessee and lessor perspectives, and provide practical examples to illustrate key concepts.

### Understanding Lease Disclosures

Lease disclosures are essential for providing stakeholders with a clear understanding of an entity's leasing activities and their impact on financial statements. These disclosures help users assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.

#### Objectives of Lease Disclosures

1. **Transparency:** To offer a comprehensive view of lease obligations and rights.
2. **Comparability:** To allow users to compare lease-related financial information across different entities.
3. **Decision-Making:** To provide relevant information that aids stakeholders in making informed decisions.

### Key Disclosure Requirements under IFRS 16 and ASC 842

Both IFRS 16 and ASC 842 require entities to disclose qualitative and quantitative information about their leasing activities. While there are similarities between the two standards, there are also notable differences that entities must be aware of.

#### Lessee Disclosures

Lessee disclosures focus on providing information about the rights and obligations arising from lease contracts. Key disclosure requirements include:

1. **General Information:**
   - A description of the nature of leasing activities.
   - Information about lease terms, including renewal and termination options.
   - Details on any restrictions or covenants imposed by leases.

2. **Quantitative Disclosures:**
   - Total lease liabilities, distinguishing between current and non-current portions.
   - Right-of-use assets, broken down by class of underlying asset.
   - Lease expenses, including short-term, low-value, and variable lease payments.
   - Total cash outflows for leases during the reporting period.

3. **Maturity Analysis:**
   - A maturity analysis of lease liabilities, showing undiscounted cash flows for each of the first five years and the total thereafter.

4. **Reconciliation:**
   - A reconciliation of opening and closing balances of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets.

#### Lessor Disclosures

Lessor disclosures are designed to provide insights into the lessor's leasing activities and the risks associated with them. Key disclosure requirements include:

1. **General Information:**
   - A description of leasing arrangements and significant lease terms.
   - Information about lease modifications and reassessments.

2. **Quantitative Disclosures:**
   - Lease income, including variable lease payments and income from subleasing.
   - A maturity analysis of lease payments receivable, similar to lessee disclosures.

3. **Risk Management:**
   - Information about how the lessor manages risks associated with residual values.

### Practical Examples and Case Studies

To better understand these disclosure requirements, let's explore some practical examples and case studies that illustrate how entities might present lease information in their financial statements.

#### Example 1: Lessee Disclosure

**Company A**, a retail chain, has several lease agreements for its store locations. The company discloses the following information in its financial statements:

- **Nature of Leasing Activities:** Company A leases retail space with lease terms ranging from 5 to 10 years. Some leases include options to extend or terminate early.
- **Lease Liabilities:** Total lease liabilities amount to $10 million, with $2 million due within the next 12 months.
- **Right-of-Use Assets:** The carrying amount of right-of-use assets is $8 million, categorized by retail and office space.
- **Lease Expenses:** During the reporting period, Company A incurred $500,000 in short-term lease expenses and $200,000 in variable lease payments.

#### Example 2: Lessor Disclosure

**Company B**, an equipment leasing company, provides the following disclosures:

- **Nature of Leasing Activities:** Company B leases industrial equipment with terms ranging from 3 to 7 years. The leases include options for purchase at the end of the term.
- **Lease Income:** Total lease income for the period is $5 million, including $500,000 from variable lease payments.
- **Maturity Analysis:** The maturity analysis of lease payments receivable shows $3 million due within the next 12 months and $7 million thereafter.

### Real-World Applications and Regulatory Scenarios

Understanding the practical implications of lease disclosures is crucial for compliance and strategic decision-making. Here are some real-world applications and regulatory scenarios:

#### Impact on Financial Ratios

Lease disclosures can significantly impact financial ratios, such as the debt-to-equity ratio and return on assets. Entities must consider these effects when preparing financial statements and communicating with stakeholders.

#### Compliance with Canadian Standards

Canadian entities must comply with IFRS as adopted in Canada, which aligns with IFRS 16. However, private enterprises may follow ASPE, which has different disclosure requirements. It's essential to understand the applicable standards and ensure compliance.

### Step-by-Step Guidance for Preparing Lease Disclosures

Preparing lease disclosures involves several steps, from gathering necessary information to presenting it in financial statements. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you navigate this process:

1. **Identify Lease Contracts:** Review all contracts to determine if they meet the definition of a lease under IFRS 16 or ASC 842.
2. **Gather Information:** Collect data on lease terms, payments, and any modifications or reassessments.
3. **Calculate Lease Liabilities and Right-of-Use Assets:** Use the present value of future lease payments to calculate lease liabilities and recognize corresponding right-of-use assets.
4. **Prepare Maturity Analysis:** Develop a maturity analysis of lease liabilities or receivables.
5. **Draft Disclosures:** Prepare qualitative and quantitative disclosures, ensuring they meet the requirements of the applicable standard.
6. **Review and Finalize:** Review the disclosures for accuracy and completeness, and finalize them for inclusion in the financial statements.
