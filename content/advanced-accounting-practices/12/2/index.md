## 12.2 Recognition and Measurement of Investments

Investments are a critical component of financial reporting and analysis, representing a significant aspect of a company's assets. Understanding how to recognize and measure investments is essential for accountants, especially when preparing for Canadian accounting exams. This section delves into the accounting for equity and debt securities, offering insights into the standards and practices that govern these financial instruments.

### Understanding Investments

Investments can be broadly categorized into equity securities and debt securities. Equity securities represent ownership in an entity, such as shares of stock, while debt securities represent a creditor relationship with an entity, such as bonds or notes. The recognition and measurement of these investments are governed by specific accounting standards, primarily International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Accounting Standards for Private Enterprises (ASPE) in Canada.

### Recognition of Investments

Recognition refers to the process of including an investment on the balance sheet. An investment is recognized when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity and the cost or value of the investment can be reliably measured.

#### Equity Securities

Equity securities are recognized at the time of acquisition. The initial recognition is based on the fair value of the consideration given, which may include cash, other assets, or the assumption of liabilities. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the equity securities are included in the initial measurement.

#### Debt Securities

Debt securities are recognized when the entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Similar to equity securities, debt securities are initially measured at fair value, which includes any transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition.

### Measurement of Investments

Measurement involves determining the value at which investments are reported in the financial statements. The measurement of investments can be at fair value, amortized cost, or equity method, depending on the classification of the investment and the applicable accounting standards.

#### Fair Value Measurement

Fair value measurement is applicable to investments that are classified as fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) or fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

##### Equity Securities

Equity securities that are held for trading or are part of a portfolio managed on a fair value basis are measured at FVTPL. Changes in fair value are recognized in profit or loss. For equity securities not held for trading, an entity may make an irrevocable election to present subsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income (OCI).

##### Debt Securities

Debt securities measured at fair value can be classified as either FVTPL or FVOCI. The classification depends on the business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics. Debt securities classified as FVOCI have changes in fair value recognized in OCI, with interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses, and impairment losses recognized in profit or loss.

#### Amortized Cost Measurement

Amortized cost measurement is applicable to debt securities that are held to collect contractual cash flows and where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest. The effective interest method is used to amortize any premium or discount over the life of the security.

#### Equity Method

The equity method is used for investments in associates or joint ventures where the investor has significant influence but not control. Under the equity method, the investment is initially recognized at cost and subsequently adjusted for the investor's share of the investee's profits or losses and other comprehensive income.

### Impairment of Investments

Impairment refers to a decline in the value of an investment below its carrying amount. Under IFRS 9, impairment is assessed using an expected credit loss model for debt securities measured at amortized cost or FVOCI. For equity securities, impairment is not separately recognized as changes in fair value are already accounted for in profit or loss or OCI.

### Practical Examples and Case Studies

#### Example 1: Recognition of Equity Securities

A company acquires 1,000 shares of another entity at $10 per share. The transaction costs amount to $500. The initial recognition of the investment would be:

- Cost of shares: 1,000 shares x $10 = $10,000
- Transaction costs: $500
- Total initial recognition: $10,500

#### Example 2: Measurement of Debt Securities at Amortized Cost

A company purchases a bond with a face value of $100,000, a coupon rate of 5%, and a market rate of 6% for $95,000. The bond has a maturity of 5 years. The effective interest method will be used to amortize the discount over the bond's life.

### Regulatory Scenarios and Compliance

In Canada, investments are accounted for under IFRS for public companies and ASPE for private enterprises. IFRS 9 governs the recognition and measurement of financial instruments, while ASPE Section 3856 provides guidance for private enterprises. Understanding these standards is crucial for compliance and accurate financial reporting.

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

- **Best Practices:**
  - Regularly assess the classification of investments to ensure alignment with business objectives and accounting standards.
  - Maintain detailed documentation of the rationale for classification and measurement decisions.

- **Common Pitfalls:**
  - Failing to reassess the business model for managing financial assets, leading to incorrect classification.
  - Overlooking transaction costs in the initial measurement of investments.

### Strategies for Exam Success

- Familiarize yourself with the key differences between IFRS and ASPE regarding investment accounting.
- Practice calculating fair value and amortized cost using sample problems.
- Understand the implications of impairment on financial statements and how to account for it.

### Summary

Recognition and measurement of investments are fundamental aspects of financial accounting, requiring a thorough understanding of applicable standards and practices. By mastering these concepts, you will be well-prepared for the Canadian accounting exams and equipped to handle investment accounting in professional practice.
