## 5.7 Push-Down Accounting

Push-down accounting is a specialized accounting practice that becomes relevant in the context of business combinations and consolidations. It involves the process of reflecting the acquirer's basis of accounting in the financial statements of the acquired entity. This section will guide you through the intricacies of push-down accounting, including when and how to apply these practices, with a focus on Canadian accounting standards.

### **Understanding Push-Down Accounting**

Push-down accounting is an approach that allows the acquired company to reflect the new basis of accounting established by the acquiring company in its own financial statements. This means that the financial statements of the acquired company are adjusted to reflect the fair values of the assets and liabilities as determined by the acquirer at the acquisition date.

#### **Key Concepts and Definitions**

- **Acquirer**: The entity that obtains control over another entity (the acquiree) in a business combination.
- **Acquiree**: The entity that is being acquired in a business combination.
- **Fair Value**: The price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

### **When to Apply Push-Down Accounting**

Push-down accounting is typically applied when there is a change in control of the acquired entity. This change in control can occur through various forms of business combinations, such as mergers, acquisitions, or consolidations. The decision to apply push-down accounting depends on several factors, including the regulatory environment, the preferences of the acquirer, and the specific circumstances of the acquisition.

#### **Regulatory Considerations**

In Canada, the application of push-down accounting is influenced by the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted in Canada, as well as the Accounting Standards for Private Enterprises (ASPE). While IFRS does not explicitly mandate push-down accounting, it allows for its application under certain circumstances. The decision to apply push-down accounting should be made in consultation with professional advisors and in compliance with the relevant accounting standards.

### **How to Apply Push-Down Accounting**

The application of push-down accounting involves several steps, which are outlined below. These steps ensure that the financial statements of the acquired entity accurately reflect the new basis of accounting established by the acquirer.

#### **Step 1: Determine the Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities**

The first step in applying push-down accounting is to determine the fair values of the acquired entity's assets and liabilities. This involves a thorough valuation process, which may require the assistance of valuation experts. The fair values should reflect the market conditions at the acquisition date.

#### **Step 2: Adjust the Acquiree's Financial Statements**

Once the fair values have been determined, the next step is to adjust the acquiree's financial statements to reflect these values. This involves revaluing the assets and liabilities on the acquiree's balance sheet to their fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets is recognized as goodwill.

#### **Step 3: Recognize Goodwill**

Goodwill is an intangible asset that arises when the purchase price of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. Under push-down accounting, goodwill is recognized on the acquiree's balance sheet and is subject to annual impairment testing.

#### **Step 4: Record the Push-Down Adjustments**

The push-down adjustments are recorded in the acquiree's financial statements as part of the consolidation process. These adjustments ensure that the financial statements accurately reflect the new basis of accounting established by the acquirer.

### **Practical Examples and Case Studies**

To illustrate the application of push-down accounting, let's consider a hypothetical scenario involving a Canadian company, Maple Corp, acquiring another Canadian company, Oak Ltd.

#### **Example: Maple Corp Acquires Oak Ltd**

Maple Corp acquires 100% of the shares of Oak Ltd for $10 million. The fair value of Oak Ltd's net identifiable assets is determined to be $8 million. The excess purchase price of $2 million is recognized as goodwill.

**Steps in Applying Push-Down Accounting:**

1. **Determine Fair Values**: Maple Corp conducts a valuation of Oak Ltd's assets and liabilities, determining the fair values to be $8 million.
2. **Adjust Financial Statements**: Oak Ltd's balance sheet is adjusted to reflect the fair values of its assets and liabilities.
3. **Recognize Goodwill**: The $2 million excess purchase price is recognized as goodwill on Oak Ltd's balance sheet.
4. **Record Adjustments**: The push-down adjustments are recorded in Oak Ltd's financial statements, aligning them with Maple Corp's accounting basis.

### **Real-World Applications and Regulatory Scenarios**

In practice, push-down accounting is often applied in large-scale mergers and acquisitions where the acquiring company seeks to align the financial reporting of the acquired entity with its own accounting policies. This alignment facilitates the consolidation process and provides a consistent basis for financial reporting.

#### **Regulatory Scenarios**

In Canada, the decision to apply push-down accounting should be made in accordance with IFRS and ASPE guidelines. Companies must ensure that their financial statements comply with the relevant standards and provide transparent disclosures regarding the application of push-down accounting.

### **Challenges and Considerations**

While push-down accounting offers several benefits, it also presents certain challenges. These challenges include the complexity of the valuation process, the potential impact on financial ratios, and the need for ongoing impairment testing of goodwill.

#### **Common Pitfalls**

- **Inaccurate Valuations**: Ensuring accurate and reliable valuations is critical to the successful application of push-down accounting. Inaccurate valuations can lead to misstated financial statements.
- **Impairment of Goodwill**: Goodwill recognized under push-down accounting is subject to annual impairment testing. Companies must be vigilant in monitoring for indicators of impairment and conducting thorough impairment tests.

#### **Strategies to Overcome Challenges**

- **Engage Valuation Experts**: Companies should engage experienced valuation experts to assist in determining the fair values of assets and liabilities.
- **Implement Robust Impairment Testing Procedures**: Establishing robust procedures for impairment testing can help companies identify and address potential impairments of goodwill.

### **Best Practices for Push-Down Accounting**

To effectively apply push-down accounting, companies should adhere to best practices that ensure compliance with accounting standards and enhance the reliability of financial reporting.

#### **Documentation and Disclosure**

- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation of the valuation process, including the methodologies and assumptions used to determine fair values.
- **Transparent Disclosures**: Provide transparent disclosures in the financial statements regarding the application of push-down accounting, including the impact on financial position and performance.

#### **Alignment with Corporate Strategy**

- **Consistency with Corporate Strategy**: Ensure that the application of push-down accounting aligns with the company's overall corporate strategy and financial reporting objectives.

### **Conclusion**

Push-down accounting is a valuable tool for aligning the financial reporting of acquired entities with the acquirer's accounting basis. By understanding when and how to apply push-down accounting, companies can enhance the transparency and reliability of their financial statements. As you prepare for the Canadian Accounting Exams, focus on the key concepts, regulatory considerations, and practical applications of push-down accounting to ensure a comprehensive understanding of this advanced accounting practice.
