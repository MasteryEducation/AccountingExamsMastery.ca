## 4.2 Current and Deferred Tax Liabilities and Assets

In the realm of advanced accounting, understanding the recognition and measurement of current and deferred tax liabilities and assets is essential. This section will guide you through the complexities of tax accounting, focusing on the principles and standards that govern how taxes are reported in financial statements. We'll delve into the nuances of current and deferred taxes, providing you with the knowledge needed to excel in Canadian accounting exams and professional practice.

### **Understanding Current Tax Liabilities and Assets**

Current tax liabilities and assets arise from the taxes payable or refundable for the current period. These are based on the taxable income or loss for the period, as determined by the applicable tax laws. The key is to accurately calculate the amount of tax that is due or refundable, which involves understanding the tax base and the applicable tax rates.

#### **Calculation of Current Tax Liability**

The calculation of current tax liability involves several steps:

1. **Determine Taxable Income:** Start with the accounting profit and adjust for any differences between accounting and tax rules. These adjustments include adding back non-deductible expenses and subtracting non-taxable income.

2. **Apply Tax Rates:** Once the taxable income is determined, apply the relevant tax rates to calculate the tax liability. In Canada, this involves both federal and provincial tax rates.

3. **Recognize Tax Credits:** Deduct any applicable tax credits from the calculated tax liability to arrive at the net current tax liability.

#### **Example of Current Tax Calculation**

Consider a company with an accounting profit of $500,000. After adjustments, the taxable income is $450,000. With a combined federal and provincial tax rate of 30%, the current tax liability would be $135,000. If the company is eligible for a tax credit of $10,000, the net current tax liability would be $125,000.

### **Deferred Tax Liabilities and Assets**

Deferred tax liabilities and assets arise from temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the financial statements and its tax base. These differences result in taxable or deductible amounts in future periods when the carrying amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled.

#### **Recognition of Deferred Tax Liabilities**

Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. These are differences that will result in taxable amounts in future periods. Common examples include:

- **Depreciation Methods:** Differences between accounting and tax depreciation methods can lead to deferred tax liabilities.
- **Revenue Recognition:** Timing differences in recognizing revenue for accounting and tax purposes can create deferred tax liabilities.

#### **Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets**

Deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, carryforward of unused tax losses, and unused tax credits. However, recognition is subject to the availability of future taxable profits against which these can be utilized.

#### **Valuation Allowance for Deferred Tax Assets**

A valuation allowance is required if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. This involves a careful assessment of future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and other relevant factors.

### **Measurement of Deferred Tax Liabilities and Assets**

The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets is based on the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled. This requires an understanding of enacted or substantively enacted tax rates and laws.

#### **Example of Deferred Tax Calculation**

Consider a company with a temporary difference of $100,000 due to accelerated tax depreciation. If the applicable tax rate is 25%, the deferred tax liability would be $25,000. If the company expects to utilize a tax loss carryforward of $50,000, the deferred tax asset would be $12,500, subject to a valuation allowance assessment.

### **Reporting and Disclosure Requirements**

Both current and deferred tax liabilities and assets must be reported in the financial statements. Key disclosures include:

- **Reconciliation of Tax Expense:** A reconciliation of the tax expense recognized in the financial statements with the tax expense calculated at the statutory tax rate.
- **Deferred Tax Balances:** A breakdown of the deferred tax assets and liabilities, including the nature of the temporary differences.
- **Valuation Allowance:** Details of any valuation allowance recognized against deferred tax assets.

### **Practical Applications and Case Studies**

To illustrate the application of these concepts, consider the following case study:

**Case Study: Deferred Tax Asset Recognition**

A technology company has incurred significant research and development expenses, leading to a tax loss carryforward of $200,000. The company expects to generate taxable income of $100,000 in the next year. The applicable tax rate is 30%.

- **Deferred Tax Asset Calculation:** The deferred tax asset related to the tax loss carryforward is $60,000 ($200,000 x 30%).

- **Valuation Allowance Assessment:** The company assesses the likelihood of utilizing the deferred tax asset. Given the expected taxable income of $100,000, the company recognizes a deferred tax asset of $30,000 and a valuation allowance of $30,000 for the portion that is not expected to be utilized.

### **Best Practices and Common Pitfalls**

When dealing with current and deferred taxes, consider the following best practices:

- **Stay Updated on Tax Laws:** Regularly update your knowledge of tax laws and rates, as these can impact the measurement of tax liabilities and assets.

- **Careful Assessment of Valuation Allowance:** Ensure a thorough assessment of the need for a valuation allowance, considering all relevant factors.

- **Accurate Reconciliation:** Maintain accurate records and perform regular reconciliations to ensure the accuracy of tax calculations.

Common pitfalls to avoid include:

- **Overlooking Temporary Differences:** Failing to identify and account for all temporary differences can lead to inaccurate tax reporting.

- **Inadequate Documentation:** Ensure all tax calculations and assessments are well-documented to support financial statement disclosures.

### **Regulatory Framework and Standards**

In Canada, the recognition and measurement of current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are governed by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted in Canada. Key standards include:

- **IAS 12 Income Taxes:** This standard provides guidance on the accounting treatment of current and deferred taxes.

- **CPA Canada Handbook:** The handbook provides additional guidance and interpretations relevant to Canadian accounting practice.

### **Conclusion**

Understanding current and deferred tax liabilities and assets is crucial for accurate financial reporting and compliance with accounting standards. By mastering these concepts, you will be well-prepared for Canadian accounting exams and equipped to handle tax accounting in professional practice.
