## 11.3 Government-Wide Financial Statements

Government-wide financial statements are crucial for providing a comprehensive overview of a government's financial position and the results of its operations. These statements are essential for transparency and accountability in public sector financial reporting, and they are a key component of the Canadian accounting exams. In this section, we will delve into the preparation of the statements of net position and activities, offering a detailed exploration of their components, preparation methods, and the relevant accounting standards.

### Understanding Government-Wide Financial Statements

Government-wide financial statements are designed to present the financial activities of a government as a whole, rather than focusing on individual funds. This holistic view is essential for stakeholders, including citizens, investors, and oversight bodies, to understand the overall financial health and operational results of a government entity.

#### Key Components

1. **Statement of Net Position**: This statement provides information about the government's assets, liabilities, and net position at a specific point in time. It is similar to a balance sheet in the private sector.

2. **Statement of Activities**: This statement outlines the government's revenues and expenses, showing how the net position has changed over a reporting period. It is akin to an income statement in the private sector.

### Preparing the Statement of Net Position

The statement of net position is a snapshot of a government's financial condition at a given date. It includes all assets and liabilities, both current and non-current, and provides a clear picture of the government's financial standing.

#### Assets

- **Current Assets**: These are assets that are expected to be converted into cash or used up within one year, such as cash and cash equivalents, receivables, and inventories.

- **Non-Current Assets**: These include long-term investments, capital assets (such as land, buildings, and infrastructure), and intangible assets.

#### Liabilities

- **Current Liabilities**: Obligations that are due to be settled within one year, including accounts payable, short-term debt, and accrued liabilities.

- **Non-Current Liabilities**: Long-term obligations such as bonds payable, pension liabilities, and other long-term debt.

#### Net Position

The net position is the difference between total assets and total liabilities. It is categorized into three components:

1. **Net Investment in Capital Assets**: This represents the net amount invested in capital assets, less any related debt.

2. **Restricted Net Position**: Resources that are subject to external restrictions on how they can be used.

3. **Unrestricted Net Position**: The residual amount that can be used for any purpose.

### Preparing the Statement of Activities

The statement of activities provides a detailed account of the government's financial performance over a reporting period. It highlights how the net position has changed due to revenues and expenses.

#### Revenues

- **Program Revenues**: These are revenues generated from specific programs or activities, including charges for services, operating grants, and contributions.

- **General Revenues**: Revenues not directly tied to specific programs, such as taxes and unrestricted grants.

#### Expenses

Expenses are categorized by function or program, providing insight into the cost of government services. Common categories include public safety, education, health services, and general government.

#### Net (Expense) Revenue

This section shows the net cost of each function or program, calculated as expenses minus program revenues. It highlights which programs are self-sustaining and which require funding from general revenues.

### Accounting Standards and Frameworks

In Canada, government-wide financial statements are prepared in accordance with the Public Sector Accounting Standards (PSAS), which are issued by the Public Sector Accounting Board (PSAB). These standards ensure consistency, transparency, and comparability in public sector financial reporting.

#### Key Standards

1. **PS 1201 - Financial Statement Presentation**: This standard outlines the general principles for presenting financial statements, including the statement of net position and statement of activities.

2. **PS 3150 - Tangible Capital Assets**: Provides guidance on the recognition, measurement, and disclosure of capital assets.

3. **PS 3410 - Revenues**: Addresses the recognition and measurement of revenues in the public sector.

### Practical Examples and Case Studies

To illustrate the preparation of government-wide financial statements, let's consider a hypothetical example of a municipal government, the City of Maplewood.
