## 13.5 Price Elasticity of Demand

Understanding the price elasticity of demand is crucial for managerial accountants, as it directly influences pricing strategies and profitability analysis. This section delves into the concept of price elasticity, its calculation, and its application in making informed pricing decisions. We will explore practical examples, real-world applications, and regulatory scenarios relevant to the Canadian accounting profession.

### **What is Price Elasticity of Demand?**

Price elasticity of demand (PED) measures how the quantity demanded of a good or service changes in response to a change in its price. It is a critical concept in economics and managerial accounting, as it helps businesses understand consumer behavior and optimize pricing strategies to maximize revenue and profitability.

#### **Formula for Price Elasticity of Demand**

The price elasticity of demand is calculated using the following formula:

{{< katex >}} \text{Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)} = \frac{\%\text{ Change in Quantity Demanded}}{\%\text{ Change in Price}} {{< /katex >}}

- **Elastic Demand**: When PED > 1, demand is considered elastic, meaning consumers are highly responsive to price changes.
- **Inelastic Demand**: When PED < 1, demand is inelastic, indicating that consumers are less responsive to price changes.
- **Unitary Elasticity**: When PED = 1, demand is unitary elastic, meaning the percentage change in quantity demanded is equal to the percentage change in price.

### **Factors Influencing Price Elasticity of Demand**

Several factors affect the price elasticity of demand, including:

1. **Availability of Substitutes**: The more substitutes available, the more elastic the demand.
2. **Necessity vs. Luxury**: Necessities tend to have inelastic demand, while luxuries have more elastic demand.
3. **Proportion of Income**: Goods that take up a larger proportion of a consumer's income tend to have more elastic demand.
4. **Time Horizon**: Demand is generally more elastic in the long run as consumers have more time to adjust their behavior.

### **Calculating Price Elasticity: Step-by-Step Guide**

To calculate the price elasticity of demand, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Initial and New Prices and Quantities**: Determine the initial price and quantity demanded, as well as the new price and quantity demanded after the price change.
2. **Calculate the Percentage Change in Quantity Demanded**: Use the formula:

   {{< katex >}} \%\text{ Change in Quantity Demanded} = \frac{\text{New Quantity - Initial Quantity}}{\text{Initial Quantity}} \times 100 {{< /katex >}}

3. **Calculate the Percentage Change in Price**: Use the formula:

   {{< katex >}} \%\text{ Change in Price} = \frac{\text{New Price - Initial Price}}{\text{Initial Price}} \times 100 {{< /katex >}}

4. **Compute the Price Elasticity of Demand**: Divide the percentage change in quantity demanded by the percentage change in price.

### **Practical Example**

Let's consider a Canadian coffee shop that sells a cup of coffee for $3.00. Initially, they sell 100 cups per day. After increasing the price to $3.30, they notice that sales drop to 90 cups per day. Calculate the price elasticity of demand.

1. **Initial Price**: $3.00
2. **New Price**: $3.30
3. **Initial Quantity**: 100 cups
4. **New Quantity**: 90 cups

**Percentage Change in Quantity Demanded**:

{{< katex >}} \frac{90 - 100}{100} \times 100 = -10\% {{< /katex >}}

**Percentage Change in Price**:

{{< katex >}} \frac{3.30 - 3.00}{3.00} \times 100 = 10\% {{< /katex >}}

**Price Elasticity of Demand**:

{{< katex >}} \frac{-10\%}{10\%} = -1 {{< /katex >}}

The PED is -1, indicating unitary elasticity. The percentage change in quantity demanded is equal to the percentage change in price.

### **Implications for Pricing Decisions**

Understanding the price elasticity of demand allows businesses to make informed pricing decisions. Here are some strategies based on elasticity:

- **Elastic Demand**: Lowering prices can lead to a significant increase in quantity demanded, potentially increasing total revenue.
- **Inelastic Demand**: Raising prices may lead to a smaller decrease in quantity demanded, increasing total revenue.
- **Unitary Elasticity**: Price changes do not affect total revenue significantly, so other factors should be considered in pricing decisions.

### **Real-World Applications**

In the Canadian market, businesses often use price elasticity to:

- **Optimize Pricing Strategies**: Retailers adjust prices based on elasticity to maximize sales and profits.
- **Forecast Revenue Changes**: Companies predict how changes in pricing will affect overall revenue.
- **Assess Market Conditions**: Understanding elasticity helps businesses respond to competitive pressures and market changes.

### **Regulatory Considerations**

In Canada, businesses must consider regulatory frameworks when setting prices. The Competition Act prohibits anti-competitive practices, such as price-fixing and predatory pricing. Understanding price elasticity helps businesses comply with these regulations by setting competitive and fair prices.

### **Challenges and Common Pitfalls**

- **Misestimating Elasticity**: Incorrectly estimating elasticity can lead to suboptimal pricing decisions.
- **Ignoring External Factors**: Factors such as economic conditions and consumer preferences can affect elasticity.
- **Overreliance on Historical Data**: Relying solely on past data may not accurately predict future elasticity.

### **Strategies for Overcoming Challenges**

- **Conduct Market Research**: Regularly update elasticity estimates based on current market conditions.
- **Use Advanced Analytics**: Employ data analytics tools to analyze consumer behavior and predict elasticity.
- **Consider Qualitative Factors**: Incorporate qualitative insights, such as consumer sentiment, into elasticity analysis.

### **Conclusion**

Price elasticity of demand is a vital concept in managerial accounting, influencing pricing decisions and profitability analysis. By understanding and accurately estimating elasticity, businesses can optimize pricing strategies, comply with regulations, and enhance their competitive position in the market.

### **Practice Problems**

1. Calculate the price elasticity of demand for a product with an initial price of $50, a new price of $55, and an initial quantity demanded of 200 units, which decreases to 180 units.
2. A company sells a product for $10, and demand is 500 units. If the price increases to $12 and demand falls to 450 units, what is the price elasticity of demand?

### What is the formula for calculating price elasticity of demand?

- [x] \(\frac{\%\text{ Change in Quantity Demanded}}{\%\text{ Change in Price}}\)
- [ ] \(\frac{\%\text{ Change in Price}}{\%\text{ Change in Quantity Demanded}}\)
- [ ] \(\frac{\text{Price}}{\text{Quantity}}\)
- [ ] \(\frac{\text{Quantity}}{\text{Price}}\)

> **Explanation:** The correct formula for price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price.

### If the price elasticity of demand for a product is greater than 1, the demand is considered:

- [x] Elastic
- [ ] Inelastic
- [ ] Unitary
- [ ] Perfectly elastic

> **Explanation:** When the price elasticity of demand is greater than 1, it indicates that demand is elastic, meaning consumers are highly responsive to price changes.

### Which factor does NOT affect the price elasticity of demand?

- [ ] Availability of substitutes
- [ ] Necessity vs. luxury
- [ ] Proportion of income spent on the good
- [x] The color of the product

> **Explanation:** The color of the product does not typically affect the price elasticity of demand. Factors like substitutes, necessity, and income proportion do.

### In the long run, demand is generally:

- [x] More elastic
- [ ] Less elastic
- [ ] Unitary elastic
- [ ] Perfectly inelastic

> **Explanation:** In the long run, demand is generally more elastic as consumers have more time to adjust their behavior and find substitutes.

### A product with inelastic demand will likely see an increase in total revenue if:

- [x] Prices are increased
- [ ] Prices are decreased
- [ ] Prices remain constant
- [ ] Demand increases

> **Explanation:** With inelastic demand, a price increase leads to a smaller percentage decrease in quantity demanded, increasing total revenue.

### If a coffee shop raises its prices by 10% and sees a 10% decrease in quantity demanded, the demand is:

- [x] Unitary elastic
- [ ] Elastic
- [ ] Inelastic
- [ ] Perfectly elastic
