## 11.4 Payback Period and Discounted Payback

In the realm of capital budgeting, understanding the payback period and discounted payback period is crucial for making informed investment decisions. These metrics help organizations evaluate the time required to recover the initial investment in a project. This section will delve into the concepts, calculations, advantages, limitations, and practical applications of both the payback period and discounted payback period, providing you with the knowledge needed for the Canadian accounting exams and real-world financial decision-making.

### Understanding the Payback Period

The payback period is a straightforward metric used to determine the time it takes for an investment to generate cash flows sufficient to recover its initial cost. It is a popular tool due to its simplicity and ease of calculation, especially when quick assessments are needed.

#### Calculation of Payback Period

To calculate the payback period, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Initial Investment:** Determine the total cost of the project or investment.
2. **Estimate Annual Cash Flows:** Calculate the expected cash inflows generated by the investment each year.
3. **Determine the Payback Period:** Divide the initial investment by the annual cash inflow to find the number of years required to recover the investment.

**Formula:**

{{< katex >}} \text{Payback Period} = \frac{\text{Initial Investment}}{\text{Annual Cash Flow}} {{< /katex >}}

**Example:**

Consider a company investing $100,000 in new equipment expected to generate $25,000 annually. The payback period is calculated as follows:

{{< katex >}} \text{Payback Period} = \frac{100,000}{25,000} = 4 \text{ years} {{< /katex >}}

This means it will take four years to recover the initial investment.

#### Advantages of Payback Period

- **Simplicity:** Easy to understand and calculate.
- **Quick Assessment:** Provides a rapid evaluation of investment recovery time.
- **Risk Assessment:** Useful for assessing the liquidity risk of an investment.

#### Limitations of Payback Period

- **Ignores Time Value of Money:** Does not consider the present value of future cash flows.
- **No Profitability Measure:** Fails to account for cash flows beyond the payback period.
- **Lacks Precision:** May not be suitable for projects with irregular cash flows.

### Introduction to Discounted Payback Period

The discounted payback period addresses the limitations of the traditional payback period by incorporating the time value of money. It calculates the time required to recover the initial investment in present value terms, providing a more accurate assessment of an investment's viability.

#### Calculation of Discounted Payback Period

To calculate the discounted payback period, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Initial Investment:** Determine the total cost of the project or investment.
2. **Estimate Annual Cash Flows:** Calculate the expected cash inflows generated by the investment each year.
3. **Discount Cash Flows:** Apply a discount rate to each cash flow to convert them into present value terms.
4. **Determine the Discounted Payback Period:** Sum the discounted cash flows until they equal the initial investment.

**Formula:**

{{< katex >}} \text{Discounted Cash Flow} = \frac{\text{Cash Flow}}{(1 + r)^n} {{< /katex >}}

Where:
- \\( r \\) is the discount rate.
- \\( n \\) is the year number.

**Example:**

Assume the same investment of $100,000 with annual cash inflows of $25,000 and a discount rate of 10%. Calculate the discounted cash flows for each year and determine the discounted payback period.

| Year | Cash Flow | Discount Factor (10%) | Discounted Cash Flow |
|------|-----------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| 1    | $25,000   | 0.909                 | $22,725              |
| 2    | $25,000   | 0.826                 | $20,650              |
| 3    | $25,000   | 0.751                 | $18,775              |
| 4    | $25,000   | 0.683                 | $17,075              |

Total discounted cash flows after four years: $79,225

Since the total discounted cash flows do not cover the initial investment, continue calculating for subsequent years until the cumulative discounted cash flows equal $100,000.

#### Advantages of Discounted Payback Period

- **Considers Time Value of Money:** Provides a more accurate reflection of investment recovery.
- **Better Risk Assessment:** Accounts for the diminishing value of future cash flows.
- **Improved Decision-Making:** Offers a more comprehensive view of investment viability.

#### Limitations of Discounted Payback Period

- **Complexity:** More complex to calculate than the traditional payback period.
- **Assumption of Constant Discount Rate:** Relies on a consistent discount rate, which may not reflect real-world conditions.
- **Ignores Cash Flows Beyond Payback:** Like the traditional payback period, it does not consider cash flows beyond the payback period.

### Practical Applications and Real-World Scenarios

The payback period and discounted payback period are widely used in various industries to assess the feasibility of projects and investments. Here are some practical applications:

- **Capital Budgeting Decisions:** Companies use these metrics to evaluate potential projects and prioritize investments based on recovery time.
- **Risk Management:** Helps in assessing the liquidity risk associated with long-term investments.
- **Financial Planning:** Assists in determining the time frame for investment recovery, aiding in cash flow management.

#### Case Study: Canadian Manufacturing Firm

A Canadian manufacturing firm is considering investing in new machinery to increase production capacity. The initial investment is $500,000, with expected annual cash inflows of $150,000. The firm uses a discount rate of 8% to evaluate the investment.

**Payback Period Calculation:**

{{< katex >}} \text{Payback Period} = \frac{500,000}{150,000} = 3.33 \text{ years} {{< /katex >}}

**Discounted Payback Period Calculation:**

Calculate the discounted cash flows and determine the discounted payback period.

| Year | Cash Flow | Discount Factor (8%) | Discounted Cash Flow |
|------|-----------|----------------------|----------------------|
| 1    | $150,000  | 0.926                | $138,900             |
| 2    | $150,000  | 0.857                | $128,550             |
| 3    | $150,000  | 0.794                | $119,100             |
| 4    | $150,000  | 0.735                | $110,250             |

Total discounted cash flows after four years: $496,800

The discounted payback period is slightly over four years, indicating a longer recovery time when considering the time value of money.

### Best Practices and Exam Tips

### Summary

The payback period and discounted payback period are essential tools in capital budgeting, providing insights into the time required to recover investments. While the payback period offers simplicity, the discounted payback period provides a more accurate assessment by considering the time value of money. Understanding these metrics is crucial for making informed financial decisions and succeeding in Canadian accounting exams.
